Dear Parents,

Please be informed that the invoices for the Spring Term 2015 will be sent home with your child(ren) this week. Please check your child&apos;s blue folder and backpack to ensure that you have received the invoice and accompanying documents. If you have not received the invoice by the end of the week, please contact me at isminvoicing@britishschools.co.uk.

If your child(ren)&apos;s school fees are paid by a company, then you will NOT receive the invoice. All company invoices have been sent directly to the payer.

Should your children currently be studying in the Nursery class for half day only, our academic staff highly recommend that by Spring Term all children are studying full day. This is because full day students progress much faster than half day students. Should you insist on continuing with only half day, the children must leave school before lunch time at 11:50am.

Spring Term fees must be paid by 15th December 2014. Please note that unpaid invoices after 15th December will be subject to revision at the Central Bank exchange rate + 3% of the invoice fees.

If you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact me directly at isminvoicing@britishschools.co.uk

Thank you and kind regards,

Marina Urmanova
Invoicing Manager
The International School of Moscow
