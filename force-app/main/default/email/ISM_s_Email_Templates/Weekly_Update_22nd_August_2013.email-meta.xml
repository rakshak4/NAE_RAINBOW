Dear Parents,


I am sure that as the first day of term draws nearer you are getting increasingly excited about the start of school! I am hopeful that the children feel the same way too. Certainly we are looking forward to greeting them on Monday.


Of course for some it will be their first day at ISM and for all it is their first time in a new year group. It is to be expected that there will be one or two tears and upset tummies on Monday.  Rest assured that excellent care will be taken of all students. We will do everything that we can to help them settle in. Obviously the first morning is a logistical challenge and therefore I wanted to give you a concise outline of what will happen in each area of the school.


Those arriving by bus will be assisted on arrival by monitors and academic staff. If being brought by car, please assist children to find a member of staff who will then guide them to the correct place.


Obviously those children whom are older, more independent or familiar with the school are also welcome to be dropped off at the main entrance and make their own way in.


Please refer to the links below for drop off and pick up procedures if children are driving to school by car.

Also, please be patient at drop off time on Monday and for the first few days. It is likely that procedures will be slower than normal and it may take time. Expect this. By the end of the first week, I am confident that things will run much more smoothly and of course we will review procedures to ensure this.


Lower Campus

(Years Nursery to Year 3)



Please understand that arrival on lower campus should be between 8:15am and 8:30am. Teachers will be preparing for the day until this time.


Foundation Stage (Nursery and Reception)


Teaching assistants will be waiting in the playground and entrances to escort parents and children to the correct classroom. Teachers will remain in their classrooms to greet the children.


In order to help children settle into their new environment quickly, we request that parents give them some reassurance (a quick cuddle) and then leave. While we recognise that initial separation can be difficult, this approach will prevent prolonged distress and allow them to settle and begin the day.


At the end of the day Nursery parents are welcome to come to the Nursery cloakroom to collect little ones if not travelling home on the school bus. Reception children not travelling on the school bus service will line up outside and parents should collect them from the playground.


Lower Primary (Year One, Two and Three)



Children should meet in the school hall on Lower Campus, where staff will be waiting. The academic staff for each class will then guide the children to their classrooms to begin their day.


Parents that arrive with new children to ISM may accompany them to the school hall. However to avoid congestion on the stairs we ask parents not to go to classrooms. Children will enjoy the first morning with tutors in their homeroom class before specialist lessons begin after lunch.


At the end of the day all Year 1 to 3 children not travelling home on the school bus service will line up for collection in the playground. Parents should please collect them from there at 3:15.


From the second day onwards all lower campus students can go straight to their locker in order to leave their belongings and change to their indoor school shoes before heading to their classes. There will be members of staff in the locker rooms and Mrs. Doubleday will be on the front gate as always should anyone be unsure of where to go.


Upper Campus

(Year 4 to Year 11)



Arrival on Upper Campus should be between 8:10 and 8:25. Please understand that teachers will be preparing for the day until this time.


All children (Year Four to Year Eleven)



In order to avoid congestion in the corridors we ask all adults that arrive with their children to separate at the entrance. Please do not worry about students finding their way to classes, as academic staff will be waiting in reception to guide students.


Children will enjoy the first part of the day with their tutors in their homeroom class before specialist lessons begin. They will gather together at the end of the day for an assembly led by Mr. Keach in our new Upper Campus Gym.


All parents


Please do everything that you can to assist us with these arrangements. We want the children to settle into routines as quickly as possible and gain confidence and independence around the school. These procedures will enable the day to begin with the minimum of fuss and allow the children to settle quickly into their first morning!


Obviously new parents in particular will also be keen to visit the school and meet members of staff as soon as possible.


We will also be hosting coffee mornings for all parents by phase early in the term to enable the community to interact at an early stage. Maaike in admissions will confirm the dates and times in the next weekly update.


Also please be aware that we will be holding “Meet The Teacher Evenings” at 6pm (LC Tuesday 10th Sept, UC Wednesday 11th Sept) during the third week of school, which will allow an early introduction to tutors and discuss the key routines and information for the year.


More detailed information will be coming home with the children during the first week, including timetables, Parent/Student Handbooks and information regarding reading/library books and homework.


Curriculum letters outlining the main themes and topics covered each term will follow on in the second week.


Staff Information



Obviously, something that will help students settle quickly into their new classes is getting to know their teachers and assistant teachers as soon as possible. With this in mind, please do visit our website in the staff and employment section before Monday.


There is a brief introduction and photograph of all staff members for your information. Our apologies that the photographs are not yet all in the same format. We are awaiting the availability of our school photographer before we can update them, hopefully this week.


Due to a systems error, at the beginning of the week some personal email addresses of staff did appear briefly on the website. They have now been replaced with school addresses ending in internationalschool.ru.


In order to respect their privacy, please do delete any record that you may have of the personal email contacts and only use the official email address when contacting teachers, assistant teachers or members of administration.


Thank you for your support on this matter, I know that our staff will be very grateful!


We look forward to greeting all students to ISM on Monday and hope that you all enjoy the last weekend of the holidays.



Looking forward to seeing you soon.
