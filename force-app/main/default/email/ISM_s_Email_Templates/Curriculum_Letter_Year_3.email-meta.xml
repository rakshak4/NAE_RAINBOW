Reminders:



ISM is a ‘Nut Free’ school, please ensure that none of the snacks the children bring into school have nuts in them (this includes birthday cakes) and of course that they are healthy (no chocolate, sweets or crisps please). Thank-you!


In Year 3 we value the importance of protecting the environment and strongly advise parents to send their child to school with a water bottle every day.


Also, please continue to wait outside for your child to come to you at the end of the day as the locker rooms get overcrowded when parents and drivers come in to help children get ready (Please remind your drivers of this).


Uniform: Due to the weekly class uniform certificate I am glad to say that in general the children’s uniform has improved this year. Please continue to support us with this and refer back to the blue parent/student handbook to see exactly what your child should wear. Eg; Black leather shoes except on PE days when trainers are to be worn.


ICT: Please remind your children to use Purplemash.com at home and to complete the weekly ‘mymaths’ challenges that are sent home once a week. Also, don’t forget to check out the ‘App of the Week’ that is added to the weekly blurb.


As always, many thanks to you for all your support and I hope that your children will enjoy their last term in Year 3!


Yours Sincerely,


The Year 3 Team,


Miss Danby (Teacher 3A) Mr. Castro (TA)

Mr. Broom (Teacher 3B)   Miss Chinhara (TA)

Mr. Charlton (Year 1, 2 &amp; 3 Phase Leader)

Mrs. Doubleday (Academic coordinator)
