Dear Parents,

In case you are planning to withdraw your child(ren) at the end of the Spring term (2nd April, 2015), please inform the Admissions department about your intentions by email no later than 10th February, 2015. Once we receive your email, we will then send you an online Withdrawal Form for you to complete.

For those families who have made payment of the Development Contribution fee, you will be entitled to an Early notice payback should you inform us of your intentions of withdrawing your child(ren) within the time frame.

If we do not receive your email by 10th February, 2015 your request will unfortunately be outside of the reimbursement time frame.

Should you know you will be withdrawing your child(ren) at the end of the school year (3rd July, 2015), feel free to inform us as well. We will of course send a reminder about the Summer term withdrawals later on in the year.

Please contact us should you have any questions in this regard.

Best Regards,

Admissions Team
The International School of Moscow
World Class Education
