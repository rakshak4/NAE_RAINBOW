Dear Parents,

Although there are still a number of weeks to go, we wanted to bring you up to date with our planning for the Year 5 Residential Trip of 2014. As always, we’re working hard to ensure that the trip will be a wonderful learning experience for the children, in a secure and exciting environment.

Why we have a Year 5 Residential Trip:

At ISM, we work to develop the children as whole individuals, and not just skilled academics. With this in mind, we consider this trip an important part of the school PSHE curriculum and the student’s personal development.

In years past, the children have visibly developed their self-confidence, independence and ability to develop friendships through the Year 5 Residential. It’s a significant step in their journey to becoming confident adults, ready to take on the world! Moreover, the children have an exciting time tackling fun challenges.


Location:

Following a successful trip last year, we will once again be visiting Extreme Land Sport Park in Nizhny Novgorod. (www.extremeland.ru).


Extreme Land is a sporting facility outside of Nizhny Novgorod offering a wide variety of individual and group activities.  The children will stay at the park during the duration of the trip in onsite accommodation.  The schedule of activities is designed to encourage both team-building and individual confidence. Qualified trainers will supervise all activities.


Timing:

Will depart by high speed Sapsan train on Monday, June 23rd and return on

Friday, June 27th. We can only book tickets 1 month or less in advance, so the precise travel times have yet to be determined.


Activities:

The children will be engaged in a wide range of exciting activities designed to keep them active and build their self-confidence. These activities will include horse riding, wall climbing, obstacle courses, target shooting, a disco, master classes in dancing and art, sports, hiking, and various team games.


Food:

We’ve been working with the camp to make sure that the food is up to a high standard and includes a good range of food in each meal that the children will enjoy. We’ve also included vegetarian options with every meal. Please let us know if your child has any specific allergies or dietary needs.


Supervision:

We will be taking all six members of Year 5’s teaching staff, and an additional staff member to ensure the children are well supervised. The camp also has a number of on-site professionals supervising the children, including an on-site doctor and security staff. In our experience, the camp’s staff members have always been both professional and capable.


Price:

The estimated cost to parents will be approximately 27 000 roubles. This figure should be finalised towards the end of Term 2.


Information Evening:

We’ll arrange a date for an Information Evening shortly later in Term 2, when you’ll be invited to ask any questions you may have about the trip. We want you to feel fully informed and confident about your child’s experience.


Following our informational evening, you will be advised on forwarding payment and permission for your child to attend.


Important Passport Note:

Please ensure that your passport and visas are up to date well in advance of the trip. These will be needed both to book tickets, and to travel on the train.


---


We strongly believe this residential trip will be a valuable opportunity for the children to build social and team skills whilst developing personal confidence and independence. It will also help the class build stronger ties between them as they continue their school life together at ISM.


We look forward to this positive experience with the children!


Kind regards,


Year 5 Staff Team
