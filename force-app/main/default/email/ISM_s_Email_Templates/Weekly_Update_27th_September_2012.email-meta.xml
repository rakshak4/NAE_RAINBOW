New School Website



Our new school website is now live! Please do find the time to visit it and enjoy the new design and features. Please understand that we are aware that the staff directory needs to be completed and that more photographs of our school do need to be added. We will be addressing these small issues in the near future. Please enjoy and do let us know if you have any feedback.


LC access



We are kindly asking you to avoid making a U-turn at the barrier (&quot;shlagbaum&quot;). This creates inconveniences for other vehicles and contributes towards the traffic issues near LC. We would appreciate if you could share this information with your drivers as well.


After School Activity programme


Here at International School of Moscow we have a varied and inclusive After School Activity programme. We are also aware that, as parents, you can also offer a lot in the way of experience and contacts.


If there are any parents that feel they can help us to enrich our ASA programme further in term two and three by leading and assisting an activity, or by providing contacts for facilities and coaches, then please contact us here in the PE department.


After school activities will run every Tuesday and Wednesday, 3.25pm to 4.25pm from 29th January and will require any volunteers or coaches to commit to every week. A limited number of ASA’s can incur a cost if the leader of the activity wishes to charge.
