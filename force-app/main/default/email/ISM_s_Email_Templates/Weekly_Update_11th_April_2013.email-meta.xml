Family Fun day- Saturday May 25th 11 am- 3pm



Our very supportive and proactive team of Parent Class Representatives met this week to discuss the organization of this great school event. The Family Fun Day will be open exclusively to the ISM school community and we hope that you will attend!



The emphasis will be on having fun and the community coming together and enjoying activities organised by our students. There will be a fund raising charity raffle for which we will be seeking donated prizes in the near future.



Please do keep this date in your diary and our class reps will be sharing more information on how you can support this event in the very near future. Please do support in any way that you can.



IPad’s for Secondary School



Just to confirm that we are now awaiting delivery of IPad’s and Laptops (Year 9) for our Secondary Students and we expect to be able to offer individual mobile devices to all students after the May break.



These devices are excellent tools to extend learning and teaching and we are sure will be of great benefit to our students. Obviously we also want to ensure that they are used appropriately and safely both in and out of school. With this in mind, we are preparing detailed information and procedures to guide home and school use in preparation for their arrival.



More information to follow!



Curriculum letters



Just to confirm that curriculum letters for all phases of the school will be sent out on Monday. They will be sent digitally from this point onwards so please do check your emails and enjoy reading what will be covered in Term Three.



Best regards,
