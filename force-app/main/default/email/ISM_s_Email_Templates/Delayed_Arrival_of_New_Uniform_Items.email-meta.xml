Dear Parents,

Please note that the new uniform delivery has been delayed because of flooding and disruption in China. We will expect the delivery to arrive after September 9th.

If it were to arrive earlier, we will let you know.

Sorry for the inconveniences.

Regards,

Administration Team
The International School of Moscow
