Dear Parents,

Any students who are taking part in Sundays Football Competition at the Anglo American School, please note that there has been a slight change to the schedule.  All students need to arrive at the fields of AAS at 9.30am and not 8.45am as originally stated.

Looking forward to seeing you all there on Sunday.

Kind regards,

Adam Hoult
Head of Physical Education
The International School of Moscow
