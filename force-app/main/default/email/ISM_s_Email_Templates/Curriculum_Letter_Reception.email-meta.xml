Dear Parents,


Welcome back to ISM for the Summer Term. This part of the year is extremely rewarding. It is remarkable to see just how far our Reception children have come. Back in August many of our Reception children were developing their pencil grip and just beginning to write their own names, now, eight months later, we have a cohort of budding writers who write their own creative stories! The children’s progress in Maths has also been impressive. Our Reception mathematicians now know all about a variety of 3D shapes, British coins and a range of measurements including length and weight. In short, our hardworking Reception children are almost ready for Year 1!


As always, we have an exciting term ahead, the highlight of which will be the annual Reception production on June 6th. Listed below are some of the most important events for Reception. You will also find an academic overview of the topics we will be covering during this term.

Reminders:


ISM is a ‘Nut Free’ school, please ensure that none of the snacks ( for bus or home rides) the children bring into school have nuts in them (this includes birthday cakes) and of course that they are healthy (no chocolate, sweets or crisps please). Thank you!


Also, please continue to wait outside for your child to come to you at the end of the day as the locker rooms get overcrowded when parents and drivers come in to help children get ready (Please remind your drivers of this).


Uniform: Please continue to support us with this and refer back to the blue parent/student handbook to see exactly what your child should wear.  Eg; Black leather shoes except on PE days when trainers are to be worn.


Water Bottles: Please remember to make sure your child has a water bottle in school everyday as the weather is getting warm and they will need to constantly drink.


You will continue to receive weekly reminders in The Reception News for information as specific dates and events approach.


As always, many thanks to you for all your support and I hope that your children will enjoy their last term in Reception!


Yours Sincerely,


The Reception Team
