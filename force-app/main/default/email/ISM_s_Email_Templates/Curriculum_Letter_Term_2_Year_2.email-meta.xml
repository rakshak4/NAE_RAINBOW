Dear Parents,


HAPPY NEW YEAR!

Hopefully you all had a wonderful break and are looking forward to Term Two!

Last term everyone worked hard to ensure a great start to the year. Well done to all!

It has been fantastic to see how the children have bonded in their respective classes as well as bonding as a whole year group.

Last term we had some awesome events that everyone enjoyed such as: Book week, Swimming Gala, Movember, ISM’s Got Talent, the end of term Christmas Carol Service as well as the Year 3 Production (which was excellent).
