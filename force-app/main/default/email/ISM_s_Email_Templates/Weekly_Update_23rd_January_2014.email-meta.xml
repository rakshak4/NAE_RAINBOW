Well done- Junior Varsity Girls Lions Basketball team

Friday 17th and Saturday 18th January saw the Junior Varsity Girls Lions make the short trip to AAS to take part in the fourth annual Penguin International Basketball Tournament.  The event played host to a large number of American Schools from around the globe including schools from Casablanca, Morocco and Warsaw.  Well done to the team on reaching the semi finals before suffering an overtime defeat 16-15. Please see the full news article on our website!
