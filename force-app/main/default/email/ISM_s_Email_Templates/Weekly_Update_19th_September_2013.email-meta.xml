Dear Parents,


We have a relatively short update this week. After School Activities have made a successful start this week and our Secondary Students have been enjoying their residential trips. We are looking forward to their return and learning about the adventures that they have enjoyed. Here in Moscow, I have been fortunate to visit several classrooms this week and pupils and staff are really settling into their work this term. It promises to be a very productive year for us all.


Phonics for Parents



All parents of our Nursery and Reception classes are invited to a presentation by our EYFS staff this evening. The objective is to provide an introduction to how we teach phonics in our EYFS classrooms and how parents can actively support children to learn in this important area of the curriculum. It will take start at 5pm this evening (Thursday  19th September) in our Lower Campus Hall. We look forward to seeing you there!


Class Representatives 2013-14



Maaike (Admissions) is still seeking one or two Class representatives to complete the team. Please do put your name forward if you would like to take an active role in school life.


Parental Feedback



We always value feedback from parents, pupils and staff alike when evaluating our school. With this in mind we are keen for all parents to take the opportunity to complete the ISI survey.


The deadline has now been extended to noon on Tuesday 24th of September and the questionnaire is available for you to complete online at http://surveys.isi.net. The unique code for your schoolâ€™s inspection is UVAX-SGZC-VKOV and you will need to enter this and your email address to be sent a link to the questionnaire.


We have also recently installed suggestion boxes in the reception area of both sites. If you have any suggestions or ideas that might improve our school, please do place them in the box and we will ensure that we read them on a weekly basis.


Pre- Inspection Visit Mr. Lewis



We are looking forward to the arrival in school of our Reporting Inspector Mr. Robin Lewis on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week. He will be making an initial evaluation of ISM in advance of the full team visit three weeks later.


Do have a wonderful weekend.
