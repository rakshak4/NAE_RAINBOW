Dear Parents,
We would like to inform you about the increase in fees, which will come into effect for the 2014-15 academic year beginning in August this year. The increase is necessary to cover the rising operating costs in Moscow and our continued investment in the development of ISM.
As you know we try to ensure that costs to our families are always considered carefully in our financial decision-making. The increase will concern the tuition fees and the bus fee. The costs of lunches and uniforms will remain the same. Please click here to download the revised fee structure.
Should you wish clarification on any information contained in the attached document, please contact our Head of Administration, Anastasia Ramazanova.
Best regards,
Paul Seedhouse
Headteacher
The International School of Moscow
World Class Education
