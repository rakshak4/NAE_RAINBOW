Dear Parents,

I am extremely proud to present the final report from the Independent School Inspectorate (please click here to download the report).

You will I hope be pleased at the detailed feedback from the inspection team. To clarify there are eight aspects that are rigorously inspected and reported upon:

- Achievement

- Curricular and extra â€“curricular provision

- Quality of Teaching

- Spiritual, moral, social and cultural development of Pupils

- Welfare, Health and Safety of Pupils

- Governance

- Leadership and Management

- Links with parents, carers and guardians

I am pleased to share with you that our school achieved the best possible result of an excellent standard in all aspects.

This outstanding achievement is the result of an incredible commitment from all parts of our community including academic, administrative and support staff, parents, pupils and the BSF board to create a school of the highest quality.

Please enjoy reading the report and do share it with your children this weekend.

Best regards,

Paul Seedhouse
