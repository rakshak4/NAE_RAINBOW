Dear Parents,

We have exciting news: our Upper Primary Student Council took upon themselves the task of presenting to the School management a proposal of trousers for female students in Year 4-6. They were so convincing that the proposal was approved and we were given the go ahead on placing the order.



The trousers for girls are produced locally and therefore are ordered individually. The design is similar to the existing boys&apos; trousers but adjusted to fit girls, you can see an example in the Uniform shop. The cost of one pair of trousers will be around 1500-1700 rubles (TBC). If you are interested in purchasing them for your child please email Irina Targonskaya at irina.targonskaya@internationalschool.ru by Friday, November 22, and indicate the student name, class, number of pairs you would like to order (limited to 2 pairs per student). The delivery date will depend on the number of trousers ordered but it is likely to be the first week of February.



If you have any questions, please email Irina Targonskaya at irina.targonskaya@internationalschool.ru.

Kind regards,

Admissions Team
