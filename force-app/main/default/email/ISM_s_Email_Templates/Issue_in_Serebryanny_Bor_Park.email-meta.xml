Dear Parents,

We have been informed of an issue in Serebryanny Bor park. Apparently, poison has been spread around the park grounds. One of our pupils lost their dog due to this unfortunate situation and we are very saddened by this news. We advise you to use caution over the next few weeks if you reside in the area.
