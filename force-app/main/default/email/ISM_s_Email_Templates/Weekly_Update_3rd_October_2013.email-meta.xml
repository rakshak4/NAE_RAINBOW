Dear Parents,


It looks a busy week ahead with the Secondary Interim reports being prepared and issued. This offers an early opportunity to review progress in that area of the school. There are two football matches next week with our under 13 and under 15 teams taking on AAS on Tuesday and Friday respectively. The photograph competition continues and we are looking forward to more entries from parents, students and staff alike.

Also Year One is looking forward to an educational visit to the Tretyakov Gallery on Wednesday.


Parent and Teacher Consultations- Nursery and Reception classes



Our second round of EYFS parent teacher consultations will take place next Thursday.

We look forward to those that have made appointments for October 10th between 4 and 6pm.


Lost and Found – a plea for support



We have noticed an already growing number of uniform and personal clothing appearing in lost and found boxes. I am sure that this is very frustrating for you and us.

It is happening despite our staff constantly reminding and supporting children to take responsibility for their belongings. We will of course continue to do so.


One thing that helps enormously is ensuring that ALL items of clothing have the FULL NAME and CLASS clearly marked on every item. This enables our staff to return items left behind to the rightful owner. Please can you assist us with this problem by adding this information to all clothing items used in school from this point onwards. Thank you for your support on this point.


Story Week - On the horizon



Our annual book week has been extended to becoming story week this year. It will focus on both reading and writing through the theme of “It’s a kind of Magic” supported by our visiting author David Webb.


Story Week will take place immediately after the half term for all EYFS and Primary classes. More information to follow shortly.


Birthday Celebrations



We always enjoy celebrating a class birthday, particularly in EYFS and Primary school. To help us ensure that things run smoothly in class please could you inform the tutor in advance if sending cakes in so that they can plan to share them at a suitable time that does not impact on curriculum time.


It helps enormously if cakes are individual and do not require cutting into 22 equal pieces of course. Individual cup cakes are an ideal solution! If you are unable to source them easily please contact one of our parents Jennifer Sherman via her website www.thesweetlifemoscow.com and she will be happy to help!


UC Students using Bus transportation



Please note that if any student usually using bus transportation but is travelling home by an alternative way on any day, it is essential that this information is shared by the parent with the school as soon as possible. Failure to do this creates issues with bus registers at the end of the day. If making alternative arrangements please contact Katie Foster on Upper Campus and Magomet on Lower Campus who track and update bus registers. Thank you for your support on this point.
