Dear Parents,

Please be informed that we have a fencing club at ISM, which takes place on Wednesdays regardless of whether there are ASAs or not.

Time: Wednesdays from 3:30 until 4:30 pm (except for holidays).
Age of participants: 8-12 y.o.
Location: Upper Campus.
Cost: 25 EUR per session.

On club days school buses are available as usual. However, when there are no clubs, transportation will need to be provided by you.

You can choose whether you want your child to attend the sessions all year long or only during club days.

Those students who already do fencing are welcome back. For those who would like to join for the first time, please email ekaterina.foster@internationalschool.ru indicating the name and the class of the child.

Thank you.

Kind regards,

Ekaterina Foster
