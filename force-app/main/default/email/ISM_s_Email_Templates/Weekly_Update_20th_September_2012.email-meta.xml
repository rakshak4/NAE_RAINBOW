    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

Welcome to the latest edition of our Weekly News!!!

True to form, please find below some interesting information and dates to mark down in your little black books.

Parent Teacher Consultations- Foundation Stage


Our first parent- teacher consultation evenings are on the horizon for Nursery and Reception students. Appointment forms will be sent out on Monday 24th September, 2012 with the children, so please make sure that you receive them at home and return them as soon as possible.


Phonics for Parents- Monday 24th September


Please be reminded that we will be holding an introduction to phonics on Monday on the Lower Campus. This session is extremely important for all Reception parents in particular but will also support progress for Nursery and Year One Students. It begins at 5:30 prompt in the Lower Campus Hall. We hope to see you there.


Class Representatives


Thankyou to all parents that have volunteered to be a class representative this year. This is a really important job that enhances the school experience for all of our students. We almost have a complete team but still need a volunteer for our 1C class.



If your son/daughter is in this class and you would be willing and able to work with the class rep team and tutors we would really appreciate your support! Please contact Maaike in the admissions office if you would like to join the team.



Once we have established a full compliment of Class reps we will get together and enjoy an initial coffee morning to discuss how we can support the work of the students and teachers this year.


Newsletter


We are finalizing the articles for our first issue of the 2012-13 ISM newsletter. We will send out the link to you at the end of next week.


Cinema Parties


A communication that we thought might be of interest to parents....



The Dome Cinema has a long tradition of arranging private birthday parties for children of all ages (and sometimes for adults as well!). Our birthday packages include a drink and popcorn for each child (in addition to the movie of course), and we provide facilities if necessary should you desire to supply additional food (pizza, cake, ice cream, etc) for the gathering. If you are interested in arranging such an event for you child, please contact us for more details on kommutator@yahoo.com

Obviously we have in no way communicated this to students in any way.



Security



Lower Campus Access:-

As of Monday 24th September, 2012 we will open up an additional pedestrian gate near the hotel security hut (where an ISM security guard usually stands to control the traffic and to open/close the barrier). You are welcome to use this gate to avoid the part of the road between the ISM security guard and the hotel barrier. Unfortunately we are not able to pave this walkway as the school is located on the territory of a nature preserve but we will do our best to keep the grass short and clean of litter.

We would also like to remind you that you can also use the pedestrian gate opposite the distant parking lot.

Uniforms Y7-Y10

Dear parents, please be informed that PE tracksuit tops were delivered early this week and are now available in the uniform shop.

Rosinka Coffee Morning


Claire Geddes, mum of Fraser (Y4A) and Charlotte (Y7A), and an experienced executive and expat coach and trainer who has helped new ISM families to understand and deal with expat life through her Culture Shock Workshop, is hosting a coffee morning for all ISM parents living in Rosinka and Angelovo on Tuesday 25th September.


If you are free, please come to Rosinka House 1204 from 10:00 â€“ 12:00. It will be a chance to catch up with old friends and meet new ones and an opportunity to arrange car-pooling when different events take place at ISM.


Maaike from the Admissions Team will be there too - so if you have any questions then you can ask her.


If you have any queries, please email Claire at familygeddes@hotmail.com
