Dear Parents,



Please see below an update of information for this week



February Events



Just a reminder of the events coming up for the remainder of this month:



8th Feb 2B Class Assembly (9:30- Lower Campus)

15th Feb 2C Assembly (9:30- Lower Campus)

21st Feb ISM Talent Show LC and UC.  (Parents of finalists will be  invited to attend)

UNICEF- Day for Change



Following on from the excellent assembly by Mrs. Hamilton on Monday, the Upper Campus will be fund raising for this worthwhile cause on Friday with a bake sale and non-uniform day. (Please note that LC children should wear uniform as normal)



Weekly Blurbs



In order to keep you fully informed about planned classroom activities we will continue to send a weekly blurb for all Foundation Stage and Primary classes up to Year 5. We hope that by sharing this information regularly, it will enable you to support your child more effectively at home. If you have not been receiving these updates please do let your class teacher know so that we can ensure that the information is reaching you.



Settling in Moscow workshop - Claire Geddes 8:30- 10:00 March 14th



Following on from the introductory session in January, one of our parents Claire Geddes will offer a follow up seminar provided particularly for parents that have recently arrived at ISM and are settling into Moscow. I am sure that it would be of great benefit – particularly for new arrivals into the city. More details will follow in the near future but please make a note of the date in your diary.



Latest Newsletter



The first Newsletter of Term Two is almost ready and will be available for you to enjoy before the end of the week via the website. We will of course inform you when it is posted.



Best regards,
