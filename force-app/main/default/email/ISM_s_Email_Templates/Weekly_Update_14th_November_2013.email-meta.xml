Dear Parents,

I am sure that if you have been following the news, you will be aware of the incredible storm that hit Asia last weekend and the awful impact for many.

Fund Raising for the Typhoon disaster

In response to the natural disaster that has devastated parts of the Philippines, the BSF community is working together to raise money. Funds raised will be sent directly to our sister school in Manila. They will coordinate the monies collected to help people in their chosen area for support: the province of Coron on Palawan Island.

There will be a donations box at the front desk in each campus from tomorrow where pupils and adults are welcome to donate money. If you are sending donations with very young children, please do so in a sealed envelope if possible.

In consultation with class representatives, it was also agreed that we will hold a charity bake sale to raise funds. The bake sale will take place at the following time and venues:

Friday 22nd November Lower Campus: LC canteen at morning break time

Friday 22nd November Upper Campus: UC Canteen at morning break time

In order to raise as much money as possible we ask families to bake individual cakes/biscuits (remember NO NUTS please) and ensure that they arrive at school first thing on Friday morning on the 22nd of November.

Of course pupils will also need money to buy the goodies so ensure that children have money in small denominations to purchase cakes.

We will of course let you know how much money we were able to raise as a school community.

Parent Suggestion Boxes

Should parents have any suggestions on how we can improve our school please do pop them in the suggestion boxes placed in the reception area of both sites.

Final week of ASAs

This was the final week of After School Activities. We hope that all pupils have enjoyed their clubs this term and we look forward to an exciting selection in January on both sites. Information will be provided at the beginning of Term Two. Thank you to Mr. Carr, Ms. Hodgson and all staff and parents involved in supporting ASAs this term.

Weekend Drama Classes at ISM

There will be free taster sessions for The London Academy of Music and Dramatic Arts Performing Arts Workshops held on our Lower campus from 09:30-12:00 on Saturday 16th, 23rd and 30th November.

To book a place or for more information please email: contact@englishinternational.ru.

Year One Class Assemblies

Well done to 1A last week on their successful firework assembly. It is the turn of 1B tomorrow and 1C next week. We look forward to this annual highlight for Year One parents.

Primary Parent Teacher Consultations

We look forward to following up the initial reports with our first parent teacher consultations for Year 1 to 6 next Tuesday and Wednesday. I hope that you will enjoy the opportunity to discuss how pupils have started the academic year and look forward to seeing you in school.
