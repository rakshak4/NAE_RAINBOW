Year 1-4 ISM Speech Day and Annual Awards Ceremony

Friday 4th July (10–11:30am)


On the final morning of school we are holding our Annual Speech Day at the Grand Marriott Hotel Ballroom. All students from Year 1 to Year 4 are of course expected to attend, as it is the final day of the academic year.

This is an extremely important event, recognising the achievements of our students and the highlights of the school year. All students and families from those year groups are invited to join us. It will offer a unique chance to get the school community together and celebrate the successes enjoyed this year.

The ceremony will begin promptly at 10am and will include musical performances and speeches from children. It will also recognise the achievements of many of our students.

Awards will be presented for each class (Y1-Y4) in the following categories:

Award for Outstanding Leadership

Award for Outstanding Citizenship

Award for Outstanding Endeavour

Awards will be presented for each year group (Y1-Y4) in the following categories:

Outstanding Creative and Performing Artist of the Year

Outstanding Sportsperson of the Year

Outstanding Linguist of the Year

Outstanding Student of the Year

So that you can enjoy the event as a family, children will sit with parents/ family members during the ceremony. The only exception will be for those children who will be performing. They will be notified prior to the event and will sit near the stage and be supervised by a member of the academic staff. Please note that this is a formal occasion therefore full school uniform including blazers, should be worn by all pupils.

The ceremony should conclude at around approximately 11:00 and will be followed by a reception of light refreshments giving the community an opportunity to say ‘farewell’ before the summer break. Please note that school buses will not be running on this day and that limited parking is available at the hotel.  Please consider this when making your arrangements for arriving at the hotel on time. Also please note that all children will leave school at Noon on Thursday July 3rd to allow staff and Year 5- 11 pupils to prepare for their awards ceremony at 6pm that evening,

I look forward to seeing you on July 4th and of course before then at one of our end of year parent and teacher consultation evenings.

Best regards,

Paul Seedhouse
