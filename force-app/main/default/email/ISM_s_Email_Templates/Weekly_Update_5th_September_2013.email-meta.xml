Dear Parents,


Please do find time to read the information below. I hope that the rather dreary weather picks up over the weekend and look forward to seeing you all next week at our Meet The Teacher Evenings.


Welcome Coffee Mornings- thank you for your support.



Thank you to all parents, old and new, for supporting the coffee mornings this week. It has been a pleasure to see such a great turnout and receive so much positive feedback on the start of the new academic year.


We look forward to meeting our Nursery and Reception families this Friday morning.


Meet The Teacher Evenings



We would like to remind all parents that we are holding these important events next week. Please note the time of the Upper Campus Evening- apologies for any ambiguity in earlier correspondence from us.


Lower Campus Meet The Teacher Evening: Tuesday 10th September 5:30- 6:30pm

Upper Campus Meet The Teacher Evening: Wednesday 11th September 6:00-7:00pm


The main objective is to give all parents an introduction to tutors and fellow parents in order to build positive working relationships at the beginning of the year. It will also offer the opportunity for teaching staff to share essential information about life at ISM.


Finally we will also be asking parents to step forward as Class representatives for this year at the meeting with tutors. This is an important role that can really support the work that we do in school.


The role involves attending Class Rep meetings with Senior Academic Staff no more than once a month and coordinating whole school events and class events. Last year the main projects were the Giving Tree at Christmas time, The Family Fun Day in May, Year Group productions and guided reading sessions in Primary School.


While the role does require some commitment we always ensure that this is manageable and enjoyable.


Scholastic Book Club



Unfortunately, our Scholastic book order got stranded at customs in June and eventually had to be returned to the UK. Our apologies to all families that have been disappointed by the non- arrival of books. However, I am pleased to confirm that Scholastic have returned any payments made, back on to your credit card.


We will of course review our options and plan to offer the opportunity to order books from the UK again during this academic year.
