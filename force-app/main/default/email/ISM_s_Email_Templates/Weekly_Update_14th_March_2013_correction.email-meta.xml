Dear Parents,



As we enter the last two weeks of term, we have Year One and Senior productions, IGCSE options evenings and of course parent teacher consultations. We look forward to seeing you in school during the lead up to our Easter break.



End of ASAS- Term Two



ASAs are now completed for Term Two. Please note that school will end at the usual time on Tuesdays and Wednesdays for the rest of term. The only exceptions will be if students have been requested by teachers to remain at school for either Productions or IGCSE evenings.



Change of staff



Unfortunately Rachael Devlin from our Drama and Music department has not returned to Moscow after the recent half term break. She has not clarified the reasons for her decision but has emphasized that she enjoyed working with our students and staff at ISM.



In reality it seems likely that the challenge of living and working In Moscow was the decisive factor. This makes me even more appreciative of the commitment and professionalism of our staff at ISM over extended periods in many cases.



Obviously we are working very hard to find a suitably talented and qualified replacement for this position and will confirm an appointment as soon as it is completed. In the meantime the staff will pull together to ensure that the quality of education is not compromised in anyway. Thank you for your support and understanding on this matter.



Maslenitsa Celebrations- Ronald Macdonald Centre



As part of the International Award, students in years 9 and 10 have been volunteering at a local Ronald McDonald Centre.  The centre is an outstanding facility which caters for children from all over Moscow, many who are orphans, have learning difficulties, many different disabilities and autism. The students have been helping to organise this excellent charity event.



If any of you are able to come down and support the event on the date mentioned on the attachment then that would be great. Please have a look and if you are interested in attending. If you would like to attend, then please do so.  If you wish to seek further information, then please do not hesitate to get in touch.

Cultural and Charity Event by IWC



Together with GlavUpDK (Main Administration for Service to the Diplomatic Corps), the International Women&apos;s Club of Moscow is introducing a culrural event cycle called “Russian Seasons”. The cycle begins with a Russian art and craft “yarmarka” (bazaar) with an opportunity to buy Russian craft, such as matryoshki, Faberge-type jewellery, wooden crafts, crystals, birch products, etc. It will be a great opportunity to purchase interesting souvenirs just before you go home for Easter holidays! The yarmarka will be accompanied by workshops, such as baltik painting and antique furniture painting, music played by a Russian folk band and a few Russian snacks, tea and coffee. You will also have the chance to meet, get to know and support those charity projects, which through IWC you are so generously supporting. They will have stands with products made by their protégés.



The event is open and free of charge, so please bring your friends, children, husbands to this event, so they can enjoy Russian craft, music and snacks too!



We are grateful for your continuous support and are very much looking forward to seeing you there!



The time and place of the event: 21 March 10:00-12:00,  Ulofa Palme street 5, building 2.
