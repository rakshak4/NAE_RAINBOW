Dear Parents,

A case of shingles has been confirmed in one of our Lower Campus classes.

It is not possible to catch shingles from someone else with the condition. The shingles virus is reactivated from a previous infection with the varicella-zoster virus (the virus that causes chickenpox) and is not transmitted by person-to-person contact.


However, it is possible for someone who has never had chickenpox to catch chickenpox from someone with shingles. For this reason please look for indications of the virus at home.

At school we will continue to monitor the children very carefully. Should any symptoms arise, we will isolate them and contact parents immediately.

Chickenpox is very contagious — most children with a sibling who&apos;s been infected will get it as well, showing symptoms about 2 weeks after the first child does. To help keep the virus from spreading, make sure your children wash their hands frequently, particularly before eating and after using the bathroom. And keep a child with chickenpox away from unvaccinated siblings as much as possible. It is recommended that you check all members of your household carefully.

What to look for

an itchy rash of spots that look like blisters
a fever
Some children have a fever, abdominal pain, sore throat, headache, or a vague sick feeling a day or 2 before the rash appears.

What to do

· Using cool wet compresses or giving baths in cool or lukewarm water every 3 to 4 hours for the first few days. Oatmeal baths, available at the supermarket or pharmacy, can help to relieve itching. (Baths do not spread chickenpox.)

· Patting (not rubbing) the body dry.

· Putting calamine lotion on itchy areas (but don&apos;t use it on the face, especially near the eyes).

· Giving your child foods that are cold, soft, and bland because chickenpox in the mouth may make drinking or eating difficult. Avoid feeding your child anything highly acidic or especially salty, like orange juice or pretzels.

· Asking your doctor or pharmacist about pain-relieving creams to apply to sores in the genital area.

· Giving your child acetaminophen regularly to help relieve pain if your child has mouth blisters.

What not to do

Never use aspirin to reduce pain or fever in children with chickenpox.

As much as possible, discourage children from scratching. This can be difficult for them, so consider putting mittens or socks on your child&apos;s hands to prevent scratching during sleep. In addition, trim fingernails and keep them clean to help lessen the effects of scratching, including broken blisters and infection.


Chickenpox is contagious from about 2 days before the rash appears and lasts until all the blisters are crusted over. A child with chickenpox should be kept out of school until all blisters have dried, usually about 1 week. If you&apos;re unsure about whether your child is ready to return to school, please consult with your doctor.

Thanks for your attention and support on this issue.


Yours sincerely,


Paul Seedhouse
