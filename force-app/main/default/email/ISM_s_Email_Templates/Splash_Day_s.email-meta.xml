Dear Parents,

Please be informed that if you are attending the year 1 splash day on Wednesday 11th December or the year 2/3 swimming gala on Thursday 12th December then you must do the following.

1 – Contact the swimming facility on +7 (495) 2347451
2 – Give them your registration details and inform them of what day you are coming.

During the event, please ensure that your car is parked around the corner from the main entrance and not directly in front.  Hopefully, by ensuring that these steps are taken, you should avoid any delays during the event.
Thank you for your understanding and I look forward to seeing you then.

Yours sincerely,

Adam Hoult
Head of Physical Education
The International School of Moscow
