Dear Parents,

Not long now until our new 2013/14 academic year begins on the 26th of August and we are very much looking forward to welcoming your children to ISM!

Parent &amp; Student Handbooks
We have attached some important information which we would like you as parents to take some time to read through. You will see we have attached the EYFS (Nursery and Reception) (please click here) Primary (Year 1 to year 6) (please click here) and Secondary (Year 7 to year 11) (please click here) Parent &amp; Student Handbooks. These have a wealth of information and will help brief you on what to plan for and what to expect leading up to the new academic year.

The Big Day!
On the 26th of August, we ask that you kindly have your children arrive at 8.15am at the appropriate campus reception area. Nursery to year 3 are located on the Lower Campus, year 4 to year 11 on the Upper Campus. Your children will be greeted by teachers and teacher assistants near the reception area of either campus. The teachers and teachers assistants will collect children and take them to class. Please note that this will be a very busy morning so your patience and good mood will be greatly appreciated!

If you believe that your children will arrive at school after the 26th of August, please let us know as soon as possible so we can arrange accordingly.

Driving Maps
In the attachments you will also find some helpful driving maps on how to approach both of the campuses in a manner which will minimise traffic and also make it a lot safer for all. Please take time to review these and also discuss with your driver should you have one. We also emphasise the fact that speed should always be kept to a minimum (less than 30 kmph) as safety is much more important than saving 30 seconds time!

School Uniforms
We recommend that you come into the school in early to mid August in order to purchase uniforms so that your child starts the day in the appropriate uniform. Waiting to purchase the uniform on the first day of school is not recommended.

Medical Requirements and Contact Details
Important to also please let us know of any medical requirements, including allergies, before your child begins here at school. You may also need to update us with your new contact details should these have changed after your relocation or summer holiday. A reminder that it is the parents responsibility to notify us of correct and up to date contact details.

Security Passes
Please note that within the first week the responsible parent or guardian will need to report to our security office on our lower campus in order to have their photo taken. A security badge will then be provided which will allow the parent or guardian to collect the child from school and/or access school grounds.

Term Fees
A quick reminder from the accounting team that Autumn term fees are payable by the 1st of August 2013.

If you have further questions after having reviewed the attached documents, please feel free to contact our admissions department. Otherwise, see you in August!

Kind regards,
