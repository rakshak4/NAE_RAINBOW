Dear Parents,


I have been privileged to enjoy two great production performances this week by our Year Two and Year Four students. Well done to them and the teaching teams behind them. Tomorrow we have our final major sporting event of the year with our Lower Primary sports Day. I hope to see you there!


We look forward to seeing you at our awards ceremonies next week for Nursery (Thursday morning), Upper Campus (Thursday evening), and Lower Campus (Friday morning) in our final celebrations of the year. Despite the warm weather, as it is a formal event, students should wear the full summer uniform, this does include blazers (except for Reception class of course).


Reports and PTCs



All students will receive their final end of year reports tomorrow. It has been a pleasure to read them and recognise the progress and achievements across the school.  Please do look after the original copies these very important documents. We cannot guarantee that we can replace them with original copies as some members of staff will inevitably move from Moscow and therefore will not be able to sign them. (I have received several requests recently to sign reports from 2009 - before I arrived!)


Please note, that reports are followed by our last parent teacher consultations of the year next Tuesday and Wednesday evening should you wish to discuss any points with staff. If you havenâ€™t received a PTC confirmation email from the front desks it means we have not received the form. If this is the case, please hand it in to the front desks as soon as possible.


French Department Update.



Just to clarify that next year Ms. Anderson will be giving up her part- time role at ISM. I am pleased to announce that her replacement in the department will be Ms. Duarte who will also work on a part- time basis along with Mr Storey and Ms. Maigne.


Returning Books and Resources


Please can we ask that all families ensure that all school resources and library books are now returned to school so that we can complete our annual collation and audit before the summer. This will greatly assist our librarians and teachers and enable us to maintain our resources year upon year. Every book that is missing is a logistical challenge to replace. We are therefore very appreciative for your support on this point.



Lost &amp; Found



Please (click here) for the UC L&amp;F list and (click here) for the LC L&amp;F list. July 5th will be the last day for you to collect the items, all unclaimed items will go to charity.

This will be our final update of the year though we do have a last Newsletter currently being prepared.

I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank you for all of your wonderful support this year and wish you a great summer break.
