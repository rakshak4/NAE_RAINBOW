Dear Parents,



Please see an information update below.



Enjoy a relaxing half term and we look forward to seeing you all back in school on Monday March 4th.




Summer Term Invoices



Please be informed that the invoices for the Summer term will be emailed and/or put into your child’s blue folders on March 4th. The payment deadline is April 1st. If you need to receive your invoice earlier to meet the payment deadline, please contact Marina Urmanova at isminvoicing@britishschools.co.uk.




Reports for Nursery to Year 5



Mid Year Reports for these year groups will be ready to come home tomorrow with students. I hope that you will enjoy reading about the progress of your children.



Please note that all students in Year One to Five are asked to complete a self-assessment as part of the report. However if this self-assessment has not yet been completed due to absence we will not be able to release the report.



As soon as your child returns to school and the self-assessment is completed we will of course send the report home for you to enjoy.



The dates for the Parent Teacher Consultations are still several weeks away and therefore we anticipate that all reports will have been completed and sent to you well in advance of these meetings.



Ice- Skating Rink



I am pleased to report that our rink on lower campus is now again operational after the mid winter thaw. Thank you for your patience while we have waited for the correct conditions to skate again. We have two more weeks of ASAs after the half term before the Year One and Senior Production week during which we hope conditions are better.



Additionally we will adapt the PE programme in Year 1- 3 to accommodate extra sessions of ice-skating for those missed by the bad weather.



ISM Maths Day



During the first week back (Wednesday March 6th) after the break we will be holding our annual Maths Day. We hope to fill the students with enthusiasm for this essential and exciting subject.



Brining up Children Abroad – Session II



Following up the success of the first Bringing Up Children Abroad Workshop, ISM is pleased to offer our parents a second workshop from Coach and mother Claire Geddes.


This session will cover two main topics:


1. Moving onwards and upwards - (preparing for a move, leaving friends and school, dealing with the &apos;hidden grief&apos; and settling into new location)


2. Expat life with teenagers - (usually the most reluctant to leave a country and the most difficult to settle).  Tips and ideas of how to guide your teenager as positively as possible.


If you would like to reserve your seat or ask any questions, please contact Claire directly on: familygeddes@hotmail.com


As the last workshop was popular, I would advise you to contact Claire sooner rather than later to guarantee your seat!




Changes in pick up arrangements


We would like to remind you that in cases when usual pick up arrangements need to be changed it is important that you inform the Front desk and/or the classroom teacher. If you or your driver are collecting someone else&apos;s child as a one off occasion we are kindly asking you to inform the Front desk and the parents of the child that you are collecting.



Have a lovely holiday,
