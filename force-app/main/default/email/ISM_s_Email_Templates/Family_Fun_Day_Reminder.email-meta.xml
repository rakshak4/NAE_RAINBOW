Dear Parents,

Since the Lower Campus field is near to lakes it would be convenient for you to wear and bring insect repellent, as there are a few insects flying around. Please also bring sun cream and hats.

Also be reminded that some of the ice creams and candy bars that will be  available thanks to our sponsors, will contain nuts. If your child(ren) have a nut allergy please make sure they are aware of this and you keep an eye on them when they&apos;re heading towards the ice cream trolleys.

We look forward to seeing you all at the Family Fun Day tomorrow.

Best regards,


The International School of Moscow
