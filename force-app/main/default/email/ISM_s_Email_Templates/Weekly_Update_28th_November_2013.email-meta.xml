Dear Parents,

We had some very excited faces this week in school with our first proper snowfall. That is great timing with our Christmas events now on the horizon.

Typhoon Relief Fund

Our bake sale last week was a huge success with the following totals being raised:
Lower Campus 105,850 Rubs
Upper Campus 126,750 Rubs
We also gathered 100 GBP, 35 Euros and 125 USD! Thank you SO much for your generosity - we will now ensure that reaches our accounts in Manila as soon as possible.

Movember

Judgement Day is swiftly arriving as our male participants brace themselves for quite literally a close shave this Friday. Please remember to provide even the smallest donations to your children for our Movember activities tomorrow raising funds for male cancers.

Giving Tree

All pupils should return home tomorrow with a gift tag from the giving tree. Please do let tutors know if this is not the case. Gifts should be brought to school only on Friday December 13th to ensure that they can be safely stored before delivery in the final week of school. Thank you again for your support.

Christmas Concert- important notice

We are reviewing our plan for the Christmas Concert to ensure maximum opportunity for participation amongst pupils and parents.
With this in mind, please understand that release of tickets will be delayed until early next week. We will of course update you as soon as possible if we do restructure the organisation of the event.

Technokidz

We would like to inform you that TechnoKidz Lego Club is now open in Krylatskoe. Classes are run in English, which provides your child with opportunity to exercise the language and meet English-speaking friends on their leisure.
TechnoKidz provides children with the opportunity to learn about engineering, science and develop their creativity, using LEGO products. Our classes are designed so that students learn technological skills through interesting, engaging and dynamic projects.

The Club is open each Sunday and is located in the Cultural Centre near metro Krylatskoe.

Key Stage Three and IGCSE Information Evening

Thank you to all parents that attended this important event on Tuesday evening. It was great to attendees gaining an insight into this important milestone in the successful journey to a university placement.


The I W C of Moscow is presenting: Winter Bazaar 2013

The Winter Bazaar is one of the key events of the year for the international community of Moscow. It is a perfect place to start your Christmas shopping to or pick up usually unavailable goods (including food and art/craft pieces) from all around the world. As the proceeds of the Bazaar go to the charity projects of the IWC it is a major fundraising event to support children, disabled people, the elderly and refugees in need. On top of this the cultural performances and the children activities make it fun for the whole family!

The International Women`s Club is kindly inviting the always supportive community of the International School of Moscow to join this great event.

The Winter Bazaar will be held at Radisson Slavyanskaya Hotel &amp; Bussines Centre, Europe Square 2, 121059, Moscow on 30th November 2013 from 10.00 am- 4.00 pm.
