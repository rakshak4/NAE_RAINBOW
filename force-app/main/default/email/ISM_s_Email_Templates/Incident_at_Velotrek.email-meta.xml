Dear Parents,

There has been a situation at Velotrek which will cause the water supply in the surrounding area to be cut off during the weekend. We are not sure if it will be back on by Monday. We will send out an email on Sunday evening by 6pm (earlier if possible) to confirm if Upper Campus will be open or not on Monday, 9th June.

Lower Campus will operate as usual.

Regards,


Admissions Team
