Dear Parents,



If you thought it was cold here….



One of our parents will be spending the early part of January in a place even whiter and possibly colder that Moscow. Niall Carton father of James and Lucy will be taking part in an extraordinary challenge at the South Pole.



For more information do see the links below:



Charity Donations page&lt;br&gt;https://www.idonate.ie/fundraiser/7679_niall-carton-s-fundraising-page---from-the-north-pole-to-the-south-pole.html

South Pole Blog &lt;br&gt;http://polarexplorers.com/blogs/index.shtml

The blog is not yet set up so will require clicking on South Pole Last Degree ski site for details when trip begins in a couple of weeks.

The expected dates of the journey are as follows:

4th January to fly to Union Glacier base camp, to fly to the start point and from 5th to 13th skiing to the pole.

14th back to Union Glacier base camp and 15th to the mountain Vinson Massif base camp at around 2000m.

18th should be Summit day at 5000m and then back to Union Glacier on 20th and to Punto Arenas in Chile on 22nd.

Fly back from Santiago on 25th Jan.

I am sure that you will join us in wishing Niall all the very best on this amazing adventure. We look forward to following his progress and hearing incredible stories on his return.
