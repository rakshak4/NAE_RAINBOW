Dear Year 8 Parents,

Please read the latest update from the group below.

&quot;All has gone well. We&apos;ve arrived back in Muscat after an incredibly busy and challenging 4 days. We are all heading to the pool now for some much needed rest and relaxation before we go shopping in the souk this afternoon&quot;.

Kind regards,

Admissions Department
