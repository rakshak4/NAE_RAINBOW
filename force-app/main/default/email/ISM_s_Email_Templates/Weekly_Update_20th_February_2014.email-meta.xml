Dear Parents,

We hope that you have enjoyed a great first half term as much as we have. Please do read the important information as always. In future weeks we will begin to post this information on the parent portal.

Mid-Year Reports Nursery â€“ Year 6

On Friday 21st February at 4:00pm the Mid-Year reports for EYFS &amp; Primary will be available for you to view on the parent portal.

The online format will look different from previous hard copy reports, however we are sure you will find the information equally informative.

There will be an achievement and effort level given for all areas.

In EYFS there will be 3 descriptors:

Above Expected Level, Meeting Expectations, Below Expected Level

In Primary there will be 5 descriptors:

Excellent, Good, Satisfactory, Improvement Needed, Cause for Concern.

Please note the following guidelines for the Primary descriptors:

Excellent: consistently achieving above the expected level.

Good: sometimes achieving above the expected level.

Satisfactory: achieving at the expected level.

Improvement Needed: sometimes achieving at the expected level.

Cause for Concern: consistently below expectations.

We hope that you enjoy reading these reports and look forward to discussing them soon at our parent teacher Consultation evenings.

After School Activities for children in Reception to Year 6

Please note that there will be NO After School Activities in the week after half term for children in Reception to Year 6. Our Parent and Teacher Consultations for EYFS and Primary children will take place on Tuesday 4th and Wednesday 5th March.  Please ensure that your child takes their usual mode of transport home, at the usual time (3.20pm).  ASAs will commence the week after (Tuesday 11th March).

Recruitment Trips

Paul Keach and I will be recruiting in the UK for the Upper Campus in the week beginning March 3rd. Should you need any support or advice on important issues we will be contactable by email though do understand that responses may be slower than usual.

Confirmation of Appointment

Another familiar face will be joining us very soon in Moscow. We are pleased to announce that we have appointed Mr. Raymond Finch as Head of the ISM Rosinka site. Ray has worked with the British Schools Foundation since 2008, having previously held Senior Management Positions at ISM before successfully taking up the Headship of The British School of Tashkent from 2010- 2013. I am sure that you will join me in welcoming Ray back to the fold.

ICT E- Safety information event- Tuesday 11th March

We will offer a second opportunity for all families to learn more about the challenges and solutions to helping children to use technology safely at home and in school. Please do make a note in your diary of this date. Refreshments will be served in the Upper Campus canteen from 8:20, and the event will begin at 8:45.

If you have any doubts about the importance of this topic, please also read the supporting article in the recent newsletter that I am sure will convince you that this session is worthy of your attendance.

ISM Rosinka Enrolments

Several current parents have contacted the admissions office asking if it might be possible to transfer to or enrol at the ISM Rosinka Primary site for August 2014. (Particularly those families that currently travel from Rosinka to our sites in Krylatskoe).

Please understand that our first commitment is to ensure that all pupils currently studying there have the opportunity to enrol. Once that process is complete we shall provide more information regarding enrolments for that site. Please do understand that this may be a complicated process through which to navigate fairly and with that in mind, I hope that you will support us with your understanding and patience.

School Closed Monday 24th February

School will be closed on Monday 24th February. If you need to contact accounts, administration or admissions, the office will be open on Tuesday until Friday from 9am until 5pm.

Have a wonderful half term break and we look forward to seeing you back in school on Monday March 3rd.
