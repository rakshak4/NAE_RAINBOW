Dear Parents,



Following on from our “Meet the Teacher” Evenings I thought it would be useful to offer more detail on how the teaching of Russian is organized across the school.



It is important to emphasise that ISM is not a bilingual school. Russian speaking families wishing to maintain Russian at the same level as a Russian curriculum school would need to seek additional solutions.

A summary of the groupings offered within most year groups is given below. I hope that you find it useful.


New Arrivals / Beginners

This group caters for children who join school with no knowledge of Russian. Children are then taken up to speed with the Russian alphabet, letter strings and syllables. They are also taught key vocabulary for the topics taught throughout the year and are introduced to the more basic grammar structures.


Beginners / Early Continuers

These lessons are designed for children with a sound understanding of the basic topic-specific vocabulary and grammar structures. Children will generally have been learning Russian for no more than a year on joining this group. All four skill-areas (speaking, listening, reading and writing) are taught here but there is greater emphasis on developing reading and speaking skills.


Continuers

A good grounding of Russian is required for this level as more complex grammar and language structures are covered here. At this level there is a strong emphasis on developing language that encourages verbal reasoning and expression of opinions. Children in continuers groups are expected to write well in the cursive script. Continuers will generally have been learning Russian for around two academic years.


Upper Continuers

At this stage children demonstrate strength in all skill areas and can generally apply all six grammatical cases to their work, albeit basic at times. This stage prepares children to be able to cope with longer literary texts and more advanced discourse. Children in the upper continuers’ group are able to write proficiently in the cursive script and can express opinions and justification with confidence.


Native Speakers / Advanced Learners

This level caters for children who speak Russian as their first language at home or who have shown fluency (both written and oral) in Russian. They have a solid understanding of more sophisticated grammar rules and are able to appreciate and discuss Russian literature with ease. Children at this level are expected to be able to plan and write essays on a broad range of topics.


Bridging Support

This group has been included to support learners who fall between two levels but would benefit from lessons in a smaller group setting so that they may move onto the next level by the end of the academic year.


Collaborative Learning

As an international school with a commitment to exposing children to the Russian language for functional purposes we feel it of the utmost importance for native and non-native speakers to work collaboratively at times during Russian lessons. This celebration and embracement of the language is of both academic and cultural benefit for all children involved.


On Lower Campus (Reception to Year 3) children will take part, on occasions, in mixed ability lessons where they will have the opportunity to engage in Russian singing and story telling. These sessions are led by our dedicated team of Russian teaching specialists and prove fun and educational.


On Upper Campus (Year 4 to Year 9) students take part, on a once fortnightly basis, in group-talk and paired reading sessions. These lessons are planned around particular topics but focus on developing students’ ability to converse, share opinions, read to one another and enjoy collaborative learning at its very best. These sessions are facilitated by our Russian teaching specialists but are very much student-led during the tasks.


Get involved

We very much value the support given by parents and this can be shown not only in your role in the home but also by supporting us in school. If you would be interested in coming in to school from time-to-time to support our team of specialists then we would very much like to hear from you. This could involve listening to our children read in Russian, joining in conversation groups and or presenting something as a guest speaker in one of our Russian lessons.


For more information on any of the above, please do not hesitate to contact Ian Storey, Head of Modern Foreign Languages, via the school switchboard or by emailing: ian.storey@internationalschool.ru
