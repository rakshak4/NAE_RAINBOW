Story week

Story week has proved a great success this week, with our visiting author being a big hit with our EYFS and Primary Children. I hope that they have returned home each evening enthused about stories. Of course tomorrow offers the opportunity for the students to dress as a favourite character. We look forward to the costumes on show!

Half Term Trips

Not all students and staff have been relaxing during the break. Residential trips to Real Madrid (Football) and London (Expressive arts) have provided fantastic opportunities beyond the classroom. Both parties enjoyed remarkable experiences and returned tired but in the words of a student “with the memories of a lifetime”

Thanks to Mr. Hoult, Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Langford for leading the trips during their own free time.

Primary School Initial reports

Reports will be sent home with Year One to Six students next Friday. This initial report will indicate how students have started the year pastorally and academically and will be followed by more detailed academic reports in Term Two and Term Three. We hope that you enjoy the reports and look forward to the parent and teacher consultations that will follow.

Board Meeting – The British School of Kuala Lumpur

Mr. Seedhouse and Mr. Keach will be out of school next week, travelling to KL for the annual BSF board meeting.

The purpose of the meeting is to discuss and agree the main improvement plans for ISM in the next 12 months and beyond. Feedback from parents, students, staff and ISI will form the basis of these discussions.

Despite an excellent report from ISI that we will be able to share with you in the near future, it remains our ambition to continue to improve and become the best school that we can be. We will of course share our plans in due course.

Additionally the meeting offers an opportunity for Heads within our Foundation to share best practice supporting consistency and quality in all of our schools. I look forward to bringing back new ideas to our school.

I am pleased that a small group of students from our Senior Choir led by Mr. Langford will be accompanying us this year. They will be hosted by families in our sister school and have the opportunity to perform as part of a BSF ensemble at the end of the week. I am sure they will thoroughly enjoy this unique opportunity and act as great ambassadors for our school as always.

Have a wonderful weekend.
