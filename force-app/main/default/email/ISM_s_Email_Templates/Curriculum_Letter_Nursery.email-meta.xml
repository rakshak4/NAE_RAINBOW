Dear Parents,

We would like to welcome back remaining parents and kindly welcome

new parents to Nursery at The International School of Moscow! We

hope that you have had a safe and relaxing holiday.


It is lovely to see the children back for their final term in Nursery. The children are continuing to become more independent and are trying even harder to achieve Mr Men certificates. Making sure the students attend full time during this term is important to get them prepared for Reception next year.


Throughout this term we will cover three topics; Transport, Under the Sea

and Growing. Through these topics the children will develop a variety

of different skills in all six areas of learning.


Each week we will continue to introduce the children to a new letter

sound. The letter sounds that we focused on last term are ‘c/k’, ‘e’, ‘h’,

‘r’, ‘m’, ‘d’, ‘g’, ‘o’, ‘u’ ‘l’, ‘f’, ‘b’ and ‘j’. The children are continuing to

enjoy learning the letter sounds through the Jolly Phonics songs and

are showing great progress in naming objects with the initial letter sounds.


Key dates for your diary are:


Tuesday 23rd April: After School Activities (ASAs) begin.


Monday 6th-10th May: Half term break.


Thursday 23rd May: Nursery Production, 9:15am start.


Saturday 25th May: Family Fun Day.


Friday 7th June: Foundation Sports day.


Monday 10th June: Nursery assessments for the whole week.


Tuesday 11th June: After School Activities (ASAs) end.


Friday 28th June: Final Reports and Sports day.


Wednesday 3rd July: Parent Teacher Consultations (PTC’s)


Thursday 4th July: Nursery Graduation. (Noon Finish)


Friday 5th July: No School for Nursery.


Reminders:


ISM is a ‘Nut Free’ school, please ensure that none of the snacks ( for bus or home rides) the children bring into school have nuts in them (this includes birthday cakes) and of course that they are healthy (no chocolate, sweets or crisps please). Thank you!


Also, please continue to wait outside for your child to come to you at the end of the day as the locker rooms get overcrowded when parents and drivers come in to help children get ready (Please remind your drivers of this).


Uniform: Please continue to support us with this and refer back to the blue parent/student handbook to see exactly what your child should wear.  Eg; Black leather shoes except on PE days when trainers are to be worn.


Water Bottles: Please remember to make sure your child has a water bottle in school everyday as the weather is getting warm and they will need to constantly drink.


You will continue to receive weekly reminders in The Nursery News for information as specific dates and events approach.


As always, many thanks to you for all your support and I hope that your children will enjoy their last term in Nursery!



We would like to thank you for supporting the children in all areas of

their learning.


Yours Sincerely,


The Nursery Team
