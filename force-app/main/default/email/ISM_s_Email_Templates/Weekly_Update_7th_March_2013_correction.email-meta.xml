Dear Parents,



Sorry for the overload of school emails but we have just realised an error in the date for the Family Fun Day.



ISM Family Fun Day



The date for this annual event has been confirmed as Saturday 25th May (times to be confirmed) Please do put this date in your diary as it is a day when the school community comes together and enjoys family orientated activities organised by the staff, students and parents. More details will follow in April.



Sorry for the inconvenience.



Best regards,
