Dear Parents,


Thank you so much for your excellent support at our annual Meet the Teacher events this week. We have received much positive feedback including a parent attending her 6th such evening describing it as “ the best yet!”


I hope that it has given you an introduction to the staff that works so hard with pupils on a daily basis.


Class representatives 2013-14



Thank you to all parents that have volunteered to support our work in school by acting as a class representative for this academic year.


We will be contacting you next week to set up an initial meeting at the end of the month.

If any form groups are still without a representative we will contact parents directly to get one in place before that meeting.
