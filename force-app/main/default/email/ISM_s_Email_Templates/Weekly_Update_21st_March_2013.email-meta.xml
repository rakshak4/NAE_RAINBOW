Dear Parents,



An update of news leading into the last week of term two.



A welcome addition to the team:



I am pleased that due to some very smart work from Mr Langford and Mr Keach, that we have a new member of the Performing Arts Team joining us on Monday.



Paul Riley-Gledhill will be joining us from the UK and he will use the next week to settle into ISM before taking over classes immediately after the Easter beak. This will mean a slight adjustment to timetables but we will keep you fully informed. I am sure that you will join us in welcoming Paul to Moscow and ISM.



ISM – an EDEXCEL Centre



Great news – we are now an IGCSE examination centre for Edexcel thanks to the efforts of Mr Rowatt and Mr Keach in particular. Well done to them and the whole of our secondary department. The addition of this well recognized examination board enables greater choice of courses within our options for Year 10 and 11.



Nuts in Snacks



Please could you assist us by ensuring that all break time snacks do not contain nuts. We are a “nut free zone’ due to allergies suffered by some of our student body.



Parent Teacher Consultations



Just a reminder that meetings will take place next week on Tuesday 22nd and Wednesday 23rd of March from 4-6pm. These meetings follow on from the reports recently issued this term. We hope to see you there.



Primary Art Week



Next week, our Primary Students will be enjoying a week of activities based on the theme of “Art from Around The World”. I am sure that the students will enjoy the opportunity to exert their creative talents further.



Leaving Time on Friday March 29th



Just to confirm that next Friday is an early finish for the end of term.

Students should be ready for departure at 11:50 on LC and 12:00 on UC.

Please ensure that you are aware of these times and make suitable arrangements to collect or receive your children.


Best regards,



The International School of Moscow
