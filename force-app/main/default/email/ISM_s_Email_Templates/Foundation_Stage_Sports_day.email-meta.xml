Dear Parents,

I would like to apologise for the short notice given when cancelling the Foundation Stage sports day this morning.  When I arrived at 7am it was looking fine but then the heavens opened. We had to make the decision before starting the event and I apologise for any inconvenience caused for you.  We are going to reschedule for Tuesday 25th June from 9 â€“ 11am and it would be great to see you all there.

Kindest regards,

Mr Adam Hoult
