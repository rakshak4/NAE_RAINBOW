Dear Parents,


Welcome to The International School of Moscow!


For returning parents, we hope that you had a fantastic summer and are looking forward to an exciting year at ISM.


As always there will be lots going on this term, in particular it will be great to ‘Meet The Teacher’ on Tuesday 10th September at 5:30pm, where you will be given lots of information that will help to build the excellent communication needed between home and school.



Year 3 will be the oldest students on the Lower Campus this year and will therefore be important role models to the other pupils in the school. There will be opportunities for some children to take extra responsibilities in school such as; Register Monitor, House point collector, House Captains and much more.  We believe very strongly that to get the best out of your child we need to all work together. We can do this on a regular basis by using the blue home/school communication books. PLEASE take the time everyday to check this and make comments if you need to.



Throughout the year we also need parent helpers so feel free to make contact with your child’s teacher to offer your help. It is also good to know YOUR specialisms and areas of strength so that when we need guest speakers or visitors of some kind we can contact people from our school community FIRST before looking elsewhere. Our basic message here is: “Let’s Work Together”.


For break time your child can bring a snack to school. PLEASE help us by packing healthy snacks such as fruit for your children. We are a ‘Nut Free’ school so please do check that your child’s snack does not contain nuts. In Year 3 we value the importance of protecting the environment and strongly advise parents to send their child to school with a water bottle every day.


We would like Year 3 students to wear FULL school uniform including blazers on Fridays. We would prefer them wear full blazers on Monday too, unless they have PE. When your child’s class performs, you will be invited to come and watch the class’ assembly. 3A’s class assembly will be on Friday 2nd May, 3B’s class assembly will be on Friday 16th May and 3C’s class assembly will be on Friday 23rd May 2014.

Year 3 Production will be on the morning of Tuesday 10th December and the evening of Wednesday 11th December 2013.


This term we also have many more exciting events happening for the children at school. Swimming will commence after the October half term break (Dates and times to be confirmed). The swimming Gala will be on Thursday 12th December. After School Activities will begin on Tuesday 17th September.  The children will also take part in the annual Book Week (w/b 28th October), where they will get to dress up as their favourite book character.

Please check the school website and Parent handbook for further dates. School Newsletters are also a great way to see what is going on at school.


Please ensure ALL items of clothing (or anything that comes into school) is clearly labelled with your child’s name.


We very much look forward to working with you over the coming year, and together helping your child fulfil their potential.


Yours Sincerely,

The Year 3 Team


Mr. Broom (Teacher 3A)                     Miss Nikolayuk (AT)
