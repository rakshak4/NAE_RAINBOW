Dear Year 10 &amp; 11 Parents,

For those of you whose child(ren) left on the residential trip yesterday, just a quick note to say that all is well and everyone has arrived safely in Tanzania.

There is no phone reception at the moment, they will have to wait 72 hours until they can connect with a local SIM.

More news to come soon.

Have a great weekend.

Best regards,

Admissions Department
