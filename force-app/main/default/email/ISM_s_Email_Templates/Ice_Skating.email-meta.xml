Dear Parents,

The school ice rink is now ready for children in years 1-3 to use during PE lessons.  It was a fantastic experience for the children last year, who got to skate with all of their school friends and pick up some skills along the way. Below are the times that each year group will start and finish Ice Skating.  This will take place in their PE lessons.

Year 1 - Week 4 (week beginning 4th February) - Week 7
Year 2 - Week 4 (week beginning 4th February)- Week 7
Year 3 - Week 7 (week beginning 4th March)- Week 10

The children can start to bring in their Ice Skates at the start of week 4.  Children must place them in the sports hall next to their allotted class sign. Children can also bring in the following equipment:

-A helmet
-Wrist protectors
-Knee and elbow protectors

A helmet will be provided by the school but if children wish to bring their own then this is fine. If you have any questions regarding the Ice Skating, please get in touch with me viaadam.hoult@internationalschool.ru.

Kindest regards,

The PE Department
The International School of Moscow
World Class Education
