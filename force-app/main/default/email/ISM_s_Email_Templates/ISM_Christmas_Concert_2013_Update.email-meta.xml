Dear Parents,

Firstly I would like to thank you for your patience whilst we have resolved some logistical issues with the Christmas Concerts, which will be held on Wednesday 18th December. Secondly, I am pleased to inform you that since making a few slight alterations to the schedule, the number of children on stage will no longer need to be limited, and that tickets will be available from the Eventbrite website after 6pm this evening. Instructions on how to register your child and book your tickets to attend the performances can be found at the foot of this letter. Please note that whilst places are no longer limited, you must still register your child for health and safety, and catering purposes.

There will be two separate concerts. Children in Years 1 – 4 will perform their concert, “The Night Before Christmas” from 6pm – 7pm in the Upper Campus New Sport Hall. There will then be refreshments served in the Old Gymnasium, which everybody is invited to attend, before the second concert begins at 7.15pm (for children in Years 5 – 11).

All students in years 1 - 9 will have the opportunity to be part of a class or group performance and are strongly encouraged to be involved. There will also be selected students in Year 10 &amp; 11 with specific roles and responsibilities in the concert. It will last until approximately 8.30pm.

All children will remain at school until the start of the concert and food will be provided for all students. If your child needs to go home after school please ensure that their class teacher has been informed of this and that they return by 5.30pm (Years 1 - 4), or 7.00pm (Years 5 - 11).  Also please make sure that suitable travel arrangements home after each concert have been made, as no buses will be running.

Children should wear school uniform with Christmas accessories e.g. tinsel in hair, Santa hat etc unless stated otherwise below:

Year 1 – Father Christmas outfit or accessories; preferably a bit dirty as he has got stuck up chimney!

Year 2 – Reindeer (brown or black clothes with antlers, or sleigh bells or even a red nose would be perfect).

Year 3 – Please ensure accessories will not interfere with playing the violin.

Year 4 – Father Christmas accessories (hat, beard, boots, sack etc).

Years 5 – 11 - All students should be in full school uniform (including blazer) for the performance, however Christmas hats and accessories are strongly encouraged!

Please do not forget to book your tickets and we look forward to seeing you for some festive fun soon!

Yours faithfully,

Asta Hodgson

Music Teacher

How To Order Tickets and Secure Performance Places

The following instructions only apply after 6pm on Tuesday 3rd December.  Any orders completed prior to this date will not be processed.

If your child wishes to perform:

- Log on the ASA website at http://www.eventbrite.com/org/2966850589

- To ensure your child will be performing in the concert please click ‘attend’ for the relevant year group (Years 1 – 9). Make sure you write their name in the attendee details box.

- You should receive an email confirming their place in the concert. Please note that by doing this you are also agreeing for them to stay at school until the concert (unless the class teacher is informed otherwise) and that you will arrange suitable transport arrangements for them to be collected after the concert at 7pm.

- Your child will not need a print out of the ticket as the school will automatically receive an electronic register based on ticket sales.

If you would like audience tickets to attend either performance:

- Log on to the ASA website at http://www.eventbrite.com/org/2966850589

- Please click on whether you would like to attend the Years 1 – 4 Concert: The Night Before Christmas, or the Year 5 - 11 Concert. Please include everyone who will be using a chair in the order i.e. not babies in prams or toddlers who will sit on your knee.

- Print out the tickets and bring them with you on the evening of the concert to gain entry.
