Dear Parents,

Photography Competition



The 2012 ISM Photography Competition is being organised by Mr. Sinkevich this year. The theme and structure of the competition will be revealed on Monday to both students and parents. We hope to receive lots of entries!


International Week



Further information regarding the organisation will be sent out to parents in advance of International week. The countries being studied are being finalized even as we speak.  We may be seeking parent volunteers from the countries that are represented.



Class Representatives Meeting



We had our first Class rep meeting of the year earlier this week with a bumper turnout. Thanks again to those that attended. It was agreed that the major focus for this term will be the Christmas Class Celebrations on Friday December 14th. Please put that in your diary at an early stage as Class reps will be hoping that as many parents as possible will be able to support the festivities on this day. It may seem a long way off but as always will approach us rapidly.


Early Departures from School - An Important Request!



Please understand that all students that arrive at school are expected wherever possible to complete the whole of the school day. We cannot support students leaving without permission from the school as this causes serious issues with regards of tracking students for attendance in lessons, travelling on buses and of course for fire drills. This is therefore an important issue.



With this in mind, we ask all parents to notify the tutor in writing at least 24 hours in advance of an early departure so that we can give permission and notify the relevant parties concerned.


Please note that this request also applies to students that have registered for After School activities.


We will be reviewing these procedures closely in the coming weeks and appreciate your understanding and support on this issue.


Newsletter


Finally, the first issue of our Newsletter for this academic year is now completed. Click here to read the latest newsletter! Enjoy a summary of what has been happening at ISM in the first few weeks. We hope that you enjoy the contents.


Best regards,
