Dear Parents,


Welcome to The International School of Moscow! We trust that you enjoyed a safe and relaxing summer, and are ready for the excitement of another school year. As with every year, we are fully focused on ensuring every child progresses and fulfills their full potential. We believe that parents are instrumental in achieving this, so your active support is always warmly appreciated.


As always there will be much going on this term. To begin with, we would like to invite you to our ‘Meet The Teacher’ evening on Wednesday the 11th of September at 6pm where you will be introduced to your child’s teaching team and given some guidance on what your child’s year of education will be like.

In order to help the children achieve to the best of their abilities, we will work hard to keep you fully informed of school activities. Each week we will email you an informative Weekly Blurb that contains details of what your child has studied at school. You should also consult the school website and newsletter regularly for other important news and dates. Finally, you should monitor or ask about your child’s book-bag regularly, as notes home and permission slips are also often issued.


We look forward to working together with you over the coming school year to help your children achieve great personal and academic success!


Yours Faithfully,



Year 6 Teaching Team
