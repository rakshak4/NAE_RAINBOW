Dear Parents,



On Monday 22nd April, all students at ISM will take part in celebrating Earth Day, an annual day celebrated in more than 192 countries every year. On Earth Day, events are held worldwide to raise awareness and demonstrate support for environmental protection. The theme of this year’s Earth Day is ‘The Face of Climate Change’. We will use the day to focus on the causes and effects of climate change on both our local environment and on a global scale. The aim is to raise awareness amongst the students whilst teaching them how they can do their part to help protect the environment.
