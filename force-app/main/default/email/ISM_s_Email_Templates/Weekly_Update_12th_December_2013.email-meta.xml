Dear Parents,

As we enter our last week, it is feeling more wintry and “Christmassy” in school. The Year 3 and Year 6 productions have been going really well and always add an extra spark at this time of year.

It has also been great to see our Secondary parents in school reflecting on the end of term reports.

Next week we are hosting the Christmas Carol Concert on the upper campus and of course we hope to see many of you there to enjoy a little Christmas spirit. Please note that the concert is organised into two parts:

Wednesday 18th December

Year One – Four   6:00- 7:00 PM

Year Five- Eleven 7:15- 8:15 PM

Giving Tree Reminder

Please note that tomorrow, Friday December 13th is the day when all gifts should be brought into school to be gathered under the Giving Trees on both sites, so that they can be organised for delivery next week. Thank you for your support and generosity in supporting this important school activity.

ICT Information session

Please do remember that on Tuesday 17th December we will be holding an information session for all parents of students in the Secondary School about the ways in which new technologies are used to support learning at ISM.

Refreshments will be served from 8.30am on the upper campus and the session will begin promptly in the Old Gymnasium at 9.00am. We hope to see you there for this important session.

Individual Music Tuition Spring Term

Please click here to download the request form for individual music lessons next term. Please ensure that the form is returned by Wednesday 15th January to reception. Regrettably we cannot process applications after this date.

Safety at pick-up time- Upper Campus

Our security team has also asked me to remind all parents, drivers and nannies on our upper campus to ensure, wherever possible, that pupils are picked up and dropped off at the school entrance. We are particularly keen to avoid children crossing the busy road unescorted at this busy time. Your support on this matter can ensure that pupils remain safe on their way into school at all times.

Enjoy the snow this weekend.
