Dear Parents,

We have just received news from Mrs. Hamilton and the Oman residential group.

&quot;The children did great on the mountain challenge and are just about to head to the pool for some very well deserved relaxation. We are heading into Muscat in a couple of hours for some sight seeing and a visit to a typical souk&quot;.

The children will arrive in Moscow tomorrow at 11pm.

Best regards,

The International School of Moscow
