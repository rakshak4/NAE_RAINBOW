Dear Parents,

Please note that due to unforeseen circumstances swimming is postponed this week. There was a slight mis-communication error between the school and the swimming centre. Swimming will definitely take place next week, so please make sure all children have their full swimming kit.

We are sorry that this happened and would like to thank you for your continued support.
