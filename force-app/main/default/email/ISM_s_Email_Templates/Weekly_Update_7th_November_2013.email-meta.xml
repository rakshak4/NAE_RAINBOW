Dear Parents,

It is 30 humid degrees with continuous rain at present. It does remind me that while harsh, the extreme nature of the seasons in Moscow does provide variety. It has been lovely to see former student Storm from Upper Primary and teacher Liz Salter enjoying their new school. However, they clearly miss ISM and send their best wishes to you all.

Board Meeting – The British School of Kuala Lumpur

I have enjoyed visiting our sister school in KL. The opening of their new Secondary Campus is on Friday and it is certainly impressive. Our long-term aim is to achieve a site of similar quality in Moscow of course.

The members of the Senior Choir that have travelled to KL have been working extremely hard in rehearsals as well as enjoying the cultural exchange opportunities this visit affords. I am sure they will perform superbly on Friday.

St Andrews Day

This traditional celebration is a British event celebrated all over the world as well as Scotland of course. With this in mind please see the information below.


The St Andrew Society of Russia is pleased to invite you to this year’s

St. Andrew’s Day Ball
