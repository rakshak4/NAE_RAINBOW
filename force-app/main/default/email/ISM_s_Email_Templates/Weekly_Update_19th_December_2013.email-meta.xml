Dear Parents,

I wanted to take this opportunity to thank all families for your wonderful support this term. The Christmas parties today have offered a suitably celebratory ending to proceedings.

Please note that our final newsletter of the term is imminent and I hope that the holiday will offer you the opportunity to enjoy the latest edition at your leisure.

Do be aware that tomorrow is our last day of term and therefore school will end at 11:50 on the lower campus and 12 Noon on the upper campus.

Please take note of this finishing time if picking up your child from school or receiving them via the school bus service.

The administration office (including the front desk of both campuses) will close at 12:30 tomorrow but will reopen on Monday. During the holidays the school will be closed from December 27 until January 8.

I hope that you have a wonderful Christmas and New Year and we look forward to seeing you back in school on Monday January 13th.

Paul Seedhouse

Headteacher
