Dear Parents,

Just a quick note to let you know that tomorrows seminar - Survival as a
Trailing Spouse - has been postponed until after the half term break due to the Inspection taking place.

Confirmation of the new dates will be sent out via email as soon as possible.

Sorry for the inconveniences.

Kind regards,

Admissions Team
The International School of Moscow
