Dear Parents

As we get ready to begin our new school year, you will be aware that residential trips are fast approaching. In order for us to complete our preparations for the trips, we require a scanned copy of the details page from the passports of all students who are attending the trip. Therefore, if your child has committed to attend a residential trip this September, could you please email a scan of their passport (details page only) to michelle.heckford@internationalschool.ru at your earliest convenience.


Kind Regards,



Michelle Hamilton
