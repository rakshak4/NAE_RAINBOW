Theatre Workshop at ISM



On Friday May 3rd, Mark Hill a Theatre Performer and director will be in school delivering a Physical Theatre workshop to the Year 10 Drama Students along with selection of Year 9&apos;s who are considering taking drama next year. This opportunity will, I am sure, enhance student knowledge and confidence in this creative subject area. Thanks to Mr. Langford for arranging this opportunity.



Summer Uniforms



Immediately after the May Break Summer Uniform will become mandatory for all students. Please consult your parent/student handbook or visit our uniform shop on Lower Campus to ensure that the students do have the proper uniform.


Blazers will still be expected on assembly days according to the normal schedule:



Year 6- 9 Monday

Year 4-5 Thursday

Year 1-3 Friday


Visit to The British School of Guangzhou



I have just returned from a review of the standards being achieved in one of our sister schools in the British Schools Foundation. It was pleasing to see that standards are consistently high across our group of schools and I have also returned with school improvement ideas for ISM. We will receive a similar visit from Mrs. Janet Brock the Head of The British School of KL later this year as part of our quality assurance procedures.



An addition to the ISM community



It is wonderful to report that Camden Lucas Charlton was born on 23/4/2013 at 20:22 weighing just under 3kg. Both Mum (Ms. Ruffin) and baby are doing very well and are looking forward to coming back to Moscow in late June. Dad (Mr. Charlton) is doing a terrific job of juggling his responsibilities here and the needs of his new family in the UK. Please click here to see the new member of the family.



International Women&apos;s Club



The Charities Group of the International Women`s Club of Moscow would like to thank all the generous donations of the community of ISM. We have collected 44 bags and 7 big boxes of donations (mainly clothes) that make a huge difference to our supported projects of foster families, orphanages, children in unfunctioning families, elderly people, people with disabilities, homeless and refugees. Thank you!


I would like this opportunity to wish you a wonderful week away from school and hope that you are able to relax and unwind. We look forward to seeing you back in school on Monday May 13th.
