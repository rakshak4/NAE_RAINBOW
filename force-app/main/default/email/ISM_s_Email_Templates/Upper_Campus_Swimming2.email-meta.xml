Re: Upper Campus Swimming


Dear Parents,


To ease the demands of facilities for Upper Campus students, swimming will take place during PE lessons for the whole of the second term. Please be assured that the swimming pool is heated and that plenty of time will be allocated for the students to dry their hair properly before returning to school. Please note that swimming is a very important part of the PE curriculum and failure to attend will have an impact on the end of year PE attainment level.


Upper Primary students will start swimming during Week 5.  This is the week beginning Monday 10th February. Students will swim over a double PE lesson, which will allow enough time for an adequate swimming session. Students will also benefit from an extra PE lesson at school that will involve Dance, Gymnastics and Basketball.


Secondary students will start swimming during the first week back after the holidays. This will be a week B. All secondary swimming lessons will only take place on a week B. As we extend our facilities to include an upper campus ice rink, we may have the opportunity to take part in skating and other winter activities during week A PE lessons.  Details regarding equipment and logistics will be shared with each class upon their return after the Christmas break.


The Upper Primary swimming gala will take place on Friday 4th April from 9am and 12pm.


The Secondary swimming gala will take place on Thursday 10th April from 9am and 12pm.


Please also note that house swimming caps are still available to purchase at a price of 350 rubles. If you have any queries about our swimming programme or the possibility of additional winter activities then please do not hesitate to contact us.


We wish you a very Happy New Year,



The PE Department
