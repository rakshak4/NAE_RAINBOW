Dear parents,

Thank you for your patience for the new on line club system.  It is a real step in the right direction as the school continues to grow and provide more and more opportunities for the students.

If you have not registered for a club, then please visit the link (click here) as clubs will start on Tuesday 23rd of April. If you require any further information then please contact each club teacher directly, all emails can be found on the school website.

Kindest regards,

Mr Hoult and Mr Carr
