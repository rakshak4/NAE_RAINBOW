Dear Parents,

This Wednesday, 3rd July, will be &quot;Football Shirt Wednesday&quot;. All students will be allowed to wear their football team&apos;s kit for the day. If they do not have a football kit then any sport&apos;s team kit will be allowed.

It will cost 100 Rubles per child and all the proceeds will go towards ISM&apos;s Madrid football tour.

Kind regards,

Stuart Hamilton
Year 4 Teacher
