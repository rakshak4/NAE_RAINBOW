Dear Parents,




As you will see we have a lot going in this the final week of school before the Christmas breakâ€¦..



Christmas Celebrations Nursery to Year 5



We hope to see you at school today to join in the fun and festivities in the morning.



Giving Tree Presents



Monday is of course the day for all gifts to be brought to school so that we can organize and distribute them during the final week. Maaike is working very hard to organize the delivery of the gifts with some of our students and families. Thanks again for your generosity.



Arc Christmas Cards



For the final week of school, Christmas Cards in support of the charity ARC will continue to be available for purchase in the reception area of both campuses.



Christmas Concerts on Wednesday 19th December



As you will be aware our annual concerts will be taking place on the evening of the 19th in our Upper Campus Hall. Please do join us to celebrate the festive season.



Christmas Celebrations Year 6- 9



Our senior students will enjoy their celebrations on the afternoon of Thursday 20th December and this will of course be a non-uniform day for these year groups only.



Friday 21st December- noon finish



Our final day at school will be on Friday the 21st of December. We will however be closing school at 12 noon to allow those travelling the opportunity to start their journey for the holiday. Bus services will be offered as normal on that day but will leave from the LC at 11:45 and 12 Noon from the UC.



Administration office closing dates



Please be aware that the Administration office, Accounts office, Admissions office and Front Desk will be closed from 27th December until 8th January 2013. If you have any questions or issues that you have to solve with any of these departments please try and do so before school closes.



Lost &amp; Found



Like every year, all items left in the L&amp;F box in the LC and UC cloakrooms will be donated to charity or thrown away. Please have a look before the holidays to retrieve your child/ren&apos;s lost items.




Best wishes,



The International School of Moscow
