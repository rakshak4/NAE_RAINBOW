Dear Year 10 &amp; 11 Parents,

The latest news from our young explorers in Africa is that they have been on a successful day time and night time walking Safari, having been able to see many animals. They have now headed North through the Serengeti across the river and towards Lake Natron.

I wish I could be there myself.

Best regards,
