Dear Parents,


We are delighted to announce that the week beginning the 28th October will be Story Week at ISM. The pupils from Nursery up to Year 6 will be involved with the aim to celebrate both reading and writing. The theme this year will be ‘magic’ and children will be taking part in a range of activities.


We are lucky to have a visiting author from the UK coming to work at our school. David Webb is already an established children’s author and writes books aimed at children aged between 6 and 12 years old. We are very much looking forward to working alongside him during the week. David will also be selling and signing his books during the week.


There will be a competition running during the week for pupils in Year 1 and a separate one for Years 2-6 to take part in. The competition will open during Monday’s assembly and will close Thursday at 3.15pm. Winners will then be announced in the Friday assembly and book vouchers awarded.


Throughout Story Week, the children will take part in many exciting book-related activities. As well as focusing on a particular author chosen by their class teachers, they will also be completing work based around the poem ‘The Magic Box’ by Kit Wright.


This year, to end the week, we would love the children to come to school on Friday 1st November dressed as their favourite character from a book. Please help to support this event by arranging a suitable costume.


We will also be offering the opportunity to purchase books during the week from the ever-popular Bookhunter book sale. This will take place on Tuesday 29th October 3-4pm for Upper Campus and Thursday 31st October 3-4pm for the Lower Campus. If you would like your child to purchase a book at the book sale, please ensure they are given small ruble notes, as it is difficult to organise a lot of change in the busy selling period.


While we are unable to invite all parents to join classes during the week, if class representatives wish to see the author working with their class or Year group, please liaise with the relevant teacher regarding times.


If you have any questions related to Story Week please do not hesitate to ask.


Yours sincerely,


Miss Ruffin and Mr Broom
