Dear Parents,


Charity Christmas Presents


Following the excellent responses from parents over the previous two years, ISM has decided again to support the Khoroshevo Mnevniki Social Centre (KMSC) by giving Christmas presents to every child in the centre. However, since ISM has grown since then, the number of presents under the giving tree exceeds that of the number of children in the centre, therefore we are going to support another centre that could do with some Christmas spirit: Sanatornyi Detskyi Dom 17.


We hope that each ISM family will be willing to donate a present, with a value of approximately RUR 800 - 1000.  No one is under any obligation to do so, and families are free to choose to purchase one present on behalf of the entire family, or one per child in their family. On 19th December, we then plan to take a group of ISM students to deliver the presents to the centres and spend some time with the children there.


As a thank you to children, Friday 14th December, the day of our Foundation stage and Primary level Christmas parties, will be a non-uniform Day for years Nursery to Year 5! For Years 6 to 10 the non-uniform day will be on Thursday 20th December, when they will enjoy their Christmas celebrations.


To facilitate this initiative, on Monday the 3rd and Tuesday 4th December each child in the school will select and bring home a gift tag chosen from the Christmas Trees on the Upper and Lower Campuses (one per child; some will select on Monday, others on Tuesday). If you notice your child has not brought a tag home please notify the tutor who will then give them a new one. If you wish either to opt out of buying a present or would prefer to provide one gift from your entire family, not per child, please inform your class teacher no later than Monday 10th December. Presents should be delivered to your classroom teacher on Monday 17th December.


The ages of the children range from 3 to 20.  In order to provide an appropriate present, we have received a special wish list from some of the children and some guidelines from the KMSC and Sanatornyi Detskyi centre’s directors about appropriate gifts. (We have put together a tag system to ensure that the presents are not only appropriate to age/gender, but that they are equally spread amongst the children in the centre).


If you would like to donate a present, then we would be very grateful if you could please follow the instructions below.


On behalf of ISM and the organizing volunteers, we would like to thank you for your continued support.  These initiatives cannot succeed without it – and there is no doubt that it will make these underprivileged children very happy this Christmas.



With thanks and kindest regards,


Volunteers ‘Orphanage Project’


Please note: presents must be delivered to your child’s class on the 17th December

General Guidelines:


Last year some parents/children wrote a small personal Christmas message to the children and these were very well received – they really made the children feel special, so we would encourage you to do this where possible. For those non-Russian speakers, Google Translate (http://translate.google.com/) is an excellent tool to use. Since the tags are very small we would ask that you write these messages on a separate card and attach this securely to the outside of the parcel itself, preferably with tape.


Please ensure that the tag identifying to whom your present is for is attached securely onto the present itself.


It is easier to transfer all presents from ISM to the orphanage if they are brought to school in a present bag, so we would ask you to do this where possible. However, even if you are placing the present in a gift bag, the label should still be attached to the present and not to the bag (this will ensure that if the present comes out of the bag for any reason, we will still be able to get it to its rightful recipient.)


Present Guidelines:


If the tag that you receive does not have a present request but just the age/gender then please follow the ideas/guidelines below:


Boys Aged 3 to 10 – Art sets, Lego sets, small personal items like rucksacks or stationary sets, clothing or clothing accessories e.g. t-shirts, slippers, hats, scarves, gloves etc


Boys Aged 11 to 20 – Computer games, board games, “funny shaped mice for computers”, personal grooming and hygiene products e.g. deodorants, shower gels, clothing or clothing accessories e.g. t-shirts, slippers, hats, scarves, gloves etc


Girls Aged 3 to 10 – Art or craft sets, “girly games, activities”, dolls, soft toys, small personal items like jewellery or other small decorative boxes, stationary sets, hair accessories, clothing or clothing accessories e.g. t-shirts, slippers, hats, scarves, gloves etc


Girls Aged 11 to 20 – Cosmetics and hygiene products, jewellery, fashion accessories e.g. hats, gloves, scarves, slippers, t-shirts, personal items like small decorative boxes etc.


**              Please avoid toys/games that require batteries.
