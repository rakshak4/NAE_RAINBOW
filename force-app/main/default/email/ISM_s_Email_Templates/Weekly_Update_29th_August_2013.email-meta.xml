Dear Parents,


We hope that you have enjoyed the first week of the academic school year and that your children have been coming home full of enthusiasm if a little tired after the long summer break. There is a tendency for a deluge of information to be sent to you at the beginning of the year.


Please do find time to read the correspondence and we promise that we will make every effort to streamline information as much as possible.


Welcome Coffee Mornings



We will host coffee mornings for each phase of the school next week. All parents are of course invited and it will offer the opportunity for new parents in particular to meet senior academic staff and also achieve links in the community.


Monday 8:30- 9:30: Secondary Parents (Year 7-11) Upper Campus Canteen

Tuesday 8:30- 9:30: Upper Primary Parents (Year 4-6) Upper Campus Canteen


Thursday 8:30- 9:30: Lower Primary Parents (Year 1-3) Lower Campus Canteen

Friday 8:30- 9:30: Early Years Parents (Nursery and Reception) Lower Campus Canteen


We look forward to seeing you next week.


Meet The Teacher Evenings



We will be holding an introductory information evening for all phases of the school in the third week of term.


Lower Campus Meet The Teacher Evening: Tuesday 10th September 5:30- 6:30


Upper Campus Meet The Teacher Evening: Wednesday 11th September 5:30-6:30


Please understand that this is an important evening that we hope you will be able to attend. More information will follow prior to the evening.


Assistant Teachers



We have initiated a change of job title for an important section of our academic staff. Teaching Assistants are now Assistant Teachers. The main reason for this change is to focus their daily work towards directly supporting the learning of students as much as possible rather than getting bogged down with administrative tasks. Class teachers will however remain in charge of all classes.


Accelerated IGCSE results



We are very proud of our current Year Eleven group. They have recently received confirmation of their IGCSE English as Second Language results.  Many international students will take this qualification at the end of Year Eleven and so we are particularly pleased to announce that all students entered achieved grades of A* to C one year early with several students achieving excellent grades. Well done to them and Mr. Rowatt for all of their excellent work.


Student Absence from School



Obviously excellent attendance at school is the key to making great progress. However, if any student is unable to attend school it is important that we are fully informed so that we can keep accurate records on our registers.


With this in mind, should any absence be necessary, please inform the class tutor directly as soon as possible. The most convenient way to communicate is via email message. Thanks for your attention and support on this point.


Medical Information



We are fortunate to have two excellent school nurses at ISM. In order for them to be able to conduct their duties it is important that we ask for your support on the following points:


1) School medical staff are not permitted to give any student medicine without the prior written permission of a certified doctor. Should any student need to take medicine in school please provide this information directly to the school nurse.


2) Should any student have any serious medical issues or allergies that we need to be aware of, it is important that this information is provided as soon as possible so that we share this information appropriately.


Please contact the appropriate school nurse directly on these points.

ISI Inspection



As I am sure that you are aware, we are looking forward to (did I really write that?) a visit from the ISI inspection team before the half term break. As part of that process, parents and students will be asked to complete a short survey on ISM for the inspection team. We will provide more information prior to the survey being presented to you.


We hope that you have enjoyed the first week back and that you are looking forward to some family time this weekend. Do be aware that on Monday, Curriculum Letters for all year groups will be sent out via email, outlining the main topics being covered this term.


Have a great weekend.


Kind regards,



Paul Seedhouse
