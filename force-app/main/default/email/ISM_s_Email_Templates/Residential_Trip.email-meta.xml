Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.LastName},

Now that we have confirmed numbers for our residential trip to Oman, we are in the process of booking flights. In order to book the flights we require a copy of the information page of each students&apos; passport. If you could please supply this either in digital or paper format by this Friday it would greatly speed up the process.

Please send digital copies to michelle.heckford@internationalschool.ru

Thank you for your support with this.

Best regards

Michelle Hamilton
