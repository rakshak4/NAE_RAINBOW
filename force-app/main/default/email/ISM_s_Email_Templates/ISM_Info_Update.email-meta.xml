Dear Parents,


It has been eerily quiet on the Upper Campus this week with so many students away on Residential visits. We look forward to hearing stories of their experiences when they return. Next week is a busy one for our Creative Arts department with Art Exhibitions on both sites and the final music recitals of the year.



Residential Trip - Oman




Please accept our apologies for the lack of regular updates regarding the residential trip in Oman. The trip has so far involved a great number of activities which have required the children and teachers to be in areas without internet access.

However, we understand all is well with everyone there and we should receive a detailed update from the teachers very soon.



Last week of ASAs



Just to confirm that this was the last week of ASAs for this term. Staff will now be preparing end of year reports to recognise the progress and achievement of students this year.



Art Exhibition - June 20th



Artwork from our student body will be displayed on both sites for the whole day on Thursday June 20th. All of our students will have the opportunity to visit and enjoy the work during the school day. We would also like to take this opportunity to invite all parents to visit the exhibition, whether it be at pick up or drop off time or indeed during the school day.



Lower Campus and Upper Campus work will be on display in the respective hall on that site.



Parent Survey



Thank you to all parents that completed the online survey sent out to you. We have now correlated the results and your feedback will inform discussions at our annual board meeting in the autumn.  We look forward to sharing with you the results and agreed actions during Term One of the next academic year.



Rosinka Announcement




We are excited to announce the opening of a small campus for Early Years and Foundation Stage  (2 - 5 y.o.) in Rosinka. We are planning to open in March 2014 accommodating Pre-Nursery to Reception ages and then offer Year 1 (5 y.o.) in August 2014. The information on the admissions process will be communicated later this month.

The opening of this campus is part of our continued efforts to provide the highest quality facilities to our students.




Speech Day and Nursery Awards Ceremony



We will be supplying invitations and key information on the above early next week in preparation for the final school event of the year.
