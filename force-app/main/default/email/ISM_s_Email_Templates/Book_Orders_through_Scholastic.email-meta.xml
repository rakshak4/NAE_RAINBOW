Dear Parents,


Please be aware that this coming Friday, 17th May is the deadline for ordering schoolbooks through Scholastic. This offers a much simpler method of payment and delivery than with our previous supplier, Baker Books.


To order books please follow this link, http://eu.clubs-school.scholastic.co.uk/international-schl-of-moscow and pay online. These books will then be delivered to the school and we will forward them to you â€“ with no postage costs for you!


Please remember not to bring any cash or order forms to the school. All orders must be done online.


Thank you for any orders already placed. Remember that all orders help generate free books for the school.


Kind Regards,


Sam Davis

Upper Campus Librarian
