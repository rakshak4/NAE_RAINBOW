Dear Parents,

What has happened to the winter? The mildness though welcome has been painful for some of our planned activities such as ice-skating and international week. Never mind, an early Spring is always welcome here in Moscow. Please enjoy the main notices for this week.

No technology Day- Monday 31st March


In order to recognise and support Earth Day, we will be switching off all classroom computers and devices at 9am on Monday 31st March. (Immediately after registration is completed) The purpose will be to raise environmental awareness amongst our community and also remind us all what a world without screens is like. This does mean that no email communication with academic staff will be possible though our administration team will remain online throughout the day.

Communication with school


As you know we have been reviewing our lines of communication to make things more efficient for all concerned. From next week we will communicate to all families following the guidelines below. This update will therefore be sent via the portal from next week.

By Parent Portal.


The parent portal will become the main line of communication for day-to-day and regular correspondence from the school that is not critical or private in nature.

The portal allows 3 types of notice:


“Blogs” or Chatter – From teachers regarding class or departmental updates EG: Weekly Class blurbs or termly curriculum letters.


Academic Progress – All major progress reports are now posted on the portal and in the future, results of more regular assessments will also be added.


Pastoral Information – Pastoral information such as awards and minor disciplinary actions will in the future be recorded and communicated via the portal.


By Email

Only critical or individual information will be disseminated using email. The use of email should be treated as exceptional and only used if the consequence for a parent of not reading the notice is extremely significant.


Examples:
School being cancelled
School reports being published.
Parent and Teacher Consultation appointment times
Leaving notice and Invoices for admissions and accounts
New major school developments or announcements such as a new campus
Any direct communication with an individual parent that sensitive or serious in nature.
Replies to parents on a particular issue raised by them.

In the future we aim to use the portal for private individual correspondence as well. Our technical team is currently working feverishly towards this objective.

Avoiding Waste- plastic cups in school

Just a short reminder that From next Monday we will remove all plastic cups from the water units placed around the school.  Please do ensure that all students come to school each day with their own re-useable water bottle and names clearly on the item.


Changes in Routine at pick- up time

We are always supportive of children attending play dates with their classmates at the end of school if confirmed by parents. However, this can be a logistical challenge on busy days when lots of families may be making these arrangements. To assist us to ensure that children are released appropriately at all times, please could we ask you to do the following if there is a change to normal pick- up arrangements:



Inform the tutor on the morning of the change so that they can remind the child of the change of arrangements

Ensure that your child is fully aware of the change of arrangements

Provide a small written and signed statement (see below) confirming that the child has permission to leave with another adult. The child should keep this with them and be able to show this to the adult on gate duty at the end of the day if asked.

A suggested (and hopefully helpful) template is set out below:

Dear ISM,

I would like to confirm that (Name of student(s)) has my written permission to be released from school under the supervision of (name and role of adult that will pick up your child(ren) at the end of school on (date).

Name of Parent:


Signature:


Date:


Have a wonderful weekend!
