    <textOnly>Dear Parents,



I hope your children have had a great and enjoyable start to the school year and will continue to do so throughout.



First week back


Our first week back has been very busy as everyone settles into the new term. It has been a real pleasure to see so many new and familiar faces back at school. Thankfully the traffic issues of the first day have settled down as everyone gets used to procedures. We will continue to monitor this closely to ensure drop off and pick up is as safe and painless as possible.


Unfortunately the weather has been wetter than expected meaning that the students have been inside more than we had hoped. However, our plan wherever possible is to give the students an opportunity to get outside and breathe fresh air wherever possible. With this in mind, please ensure that all students do bring a coat to school on cool/wet days.


Coffee Mornings



ISM would like to welcome you to the 2012-13 Academic Year by inviting you to attend the coffee mornings which will be organised as from the second week of September.


These will be done in chronological order starting with Nursery parents and finishing with Year 9 and Year 10.


Please find the dates below and write them down in your agendas. Do not miss the opportunity to meet new and not so new members of the ISM community.

Meet The Teacher Evening


We would like to invite you to our “Meet the Teacher” evenings for this academic year. These evenings are for parents only and students are not expected to attend. Please understand that we are unable to supervise students before or during the evening, as our staff will be busy preparing to greet you.


The Lower Campus evening (From Nursery up to Year 3) will take place on Tuesday September 11th.  (5:30 start- please arrive promptly as presentations will begin at this time)


The Upper Campus evening (From Year 4 to Year 10) will take place on Thursday September 13th. (5:30 start- please arrive promptly as presentations will begin at this time)


We hope that by having two separate evenings, parents with more than one child will be able to access as much information as possible. Obviously, we hope that those families with more than one child on the same site can arrange for both parents to attend different year groups.


The objectives of the evening are as follows:


· To establish strong positive relationships and lines of communication between home and school.

· To share key phase specific information not already included in our Parent/Student Handbook and curriculum letters.

· To offer you an opportunity to visit the classroom environment and meet our teaching teams.

· To understand how you can play a positive and active role in our school.


On this last point there are several things to consider in preparation for the evening:


1. Do you have skills/knowledge that you might share with our students?


- We will be asking all parents that attend to support our After School Activities, Curriculum Topics and Careers Advice development in any way that you can. We believe that we have an incredibly talented parent body with untapped skills!


2. Would you like to act as class representative for the parents in your class?


- Class representatives provide a link between the teacher and the parents. In particular, you would organize support for school and class events and productions as well as occasional social get-togethers for parents. You would also attend class representative meetings in support of the events that we organize. The role does not however require you to raise issues on behalf of parents. We always encourage individual questions to the appropriate members of staff. We would like to elect reps for each class during the evening.


One important note: Please understand that the evening is meant as a general introduction rather than a consultation for individual children. You will of course have an opportunity to meet with teachers individually later in the term to discuss the progress of your children. However it is crucial that you do attend if at all possible.


We look forward to welcoming you to these very important evenings.



Best regards,
