Dear Parents,


Welcome to The International School of Moscow! For returning parents, we hope that you had a fantastic summer and are looking forward to an exciting year at ISM.


As always there will be lots going on this term. Firstly, you are welcome to come and ‘Meet The Teacher’ on Tuesday 10th September starting at 5:30, where you will be given lots of information that will help to build the all important communication between home and school.


We believe very strongly that to get the best out of your child we need to all work together. We can do this on a regular basis by using the blue home/school communication books. Please take the time every day to check this and make comments if you need to.


Throughout the year we also need parent helpers, so feel free to make contact with your child’s teacher to offer your help. When we need guest speakers or visitors of some kind, we would also love to utilise knowledgeable people from our own school community first before looking elsewhere. Please feel free to contact your teacher via the home communication book.


For break time your child can bring a snack to school. Please help us by packing healthy snacks such as fruit for your children, as this will help them concentrate and learn more throughout the day. We are a ‘Nut Free’ school so please do check that your child’s snack does not contain nuts. In Year 1 we value the importance of protecting the environment and strongly advise parents to send their child to school with a water bottle every day.


Assemblies for everyone will be on Mondays and Fridays and the children will be required to wear their full uniform including blazers (1B and 1C can wear PE kit during the Monday assembly). Please ensure all items of clothing (or anything that comes into school) is clearly labelled with your child’s name. This helps us track clothing and teaches the children to be responsible for their own belongings.


You will be invited to watch your child perform in their class assembly nearer to the time. 1A’s assembly will be on Friday 8th November, 1B’s assembly is on the Friday 15th November and 1C’s assembly is on the Friday 22nd November 2013.


This term we also have many more exciting events happening for the children at school. Swimming will commence after the October half term break (Dates and times to be confirmed). The swimming Gala will be on Thursday 12th December. After School Activities will begin on Tuesday 17th September. The children will also take part in the annual Book Week (w/b 28th October), where they will get to dress up as their favourite book character.

Please check the school website and Parent handbook for further dates. School Newsletters are also a great way to see what is going on at school.


We would like to thank you in advance, for your time and effort in supporting the children in all areas of their learning.


Yours Sincerely,



The Year 1 Teaching Team
