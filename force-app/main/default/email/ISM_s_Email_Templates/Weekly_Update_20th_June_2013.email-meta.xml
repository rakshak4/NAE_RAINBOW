Dear Parents,


Only two weeks to go until the end of term. Our intention is to ensure that all students get the maximum out of the next two weeks both academically and socially. We appreciate your support in ensuring students are at school for the remainder of the school year wherever possible.


Having enjoyed the Art Exhibitions and Music recitals this week we have Year 2 and Year 4 productions to look forward to next week. Of course the highlight of the week for all students will be the receipt of their End of Year reports on Friday 28th June!


Academic Staff for 2013-14


I can confirm that we have been extremely successful in our recruitment of new members of staff this year. Retention of staff has also been very good with very few teachers leaving ISM at the end of this academic year.



We are of course sad to say good bye to some members of the teaching team including Mr. Swanson, Mr Shatunov, Ms. Salter (relocating to our sister school in KL) Mr. Rogers, Ms. Jones and Ms. Gaskin.



In Primary and EYFS, we will therefore look forward to introducing Ms. Greenwood, Ms. Mullally, and Ms. Roberts from the UK along with Ms. McGuire who will join us from the Middle East. Also congratulations to Mr. Chapman who will join the teaching team after spending two years at ISM and completing his PGCE with us.



In Secondary School we will be receiving additional staff to support the growth of our school.  Mr. Tumpane (Head of Maths), Mr. Miotti  (Head of English), Ms. Thompson (Head of Creative Arts), Ms. Maigne (Spanish), Ms. Duarte, Ms. Shireava and Ms Ryabatseva (Russian), Mr. Mayoh (ICT Development Coordnator) and Ms. Levine (Learning Support) will also be joining us in August.



Profiles of all our new teachers will appear on the website by mid August, so that you will be able to learn more about our new staff prior to school opening and students arriving to their new classes.



Please do understand that it is school policy not to receive requests for specific teachers or tutors from individual families or parents. It would be impractical and unfair to do so. We will of course release class lists in the final week of school as soon as enrolments are finalised so that all students know who their teacher/tutor will be for the following year before the end of school.



The International Women`s Club is Calling for Donations (clothes)

Following the success of the Spring collection of donations the International Women`s Club will be collecting donations from ISM parents and staff on Monday (July 1). The IWC Donations Office collects any unwanted clothes items and passes them on to the charity projects that we support. We can use anything and everything as long as itâ€™s clean and in good condition. If you would like to donate anything you will be able to do so on Monday, 1st July, between 3 and 4 pm in front of the Upper school campus. In case your children take the school bus you can pass a donation with the bus monitor. We are kindly asking you to ensure that it is of reasonable size (the bus capacity is limited) and is clearly labeled &quot;Donation for IWC&quot;.

In case you have other items to donate we kindly ask you to arrange it with the Donations Office directly. Please keep in mind that the last date of donations drop off before the summer break is the 8th July. For further information, please go to the website of the International Women`s Club of Moscow at: www.iwcmoscow.ru

Autumn Term Invoices

Could you please check that you have received the Autumn term invoices. These were placed in your child(ren)&apos;s blue folder. If you have not received this, please get in touch with Marina Urmanova at isminvoicing@britishschools.co.uk and she will arrange for a new hard copy to be sent to you.



Have a wonderful weekend and those of you who are attending our Golf competition on Sunday, I look forward to seeing you on the tee.
