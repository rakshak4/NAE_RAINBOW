ISM Christmas Concert


Dear Parents,


On Wednesday 19th December ISM will present the 2012 Christmas Concert – Christmas Around the World.  All children are welcome to take part, but due to the increasing number of students at the school there will be a limited number of places available.  If your child wishes to participate, I urge you to return the consent form and ticket request as soon as possible as these will be distributed on a ‘first come, first served basis’.


The organization of the concert will be slightly different this year too; year groups 1, 2 &amp; 4 (Yrs 3 and 5 will not be able to take part due to their productions) will perform in the Upper Campus Hall from 6pm for approximately 50 minutes when there will be an interval and refreshments served. After the interval the secondary children will perform for approximately 1 hour.  Free tickets for each half of the concert will be available from Thursday 6th December at reception of your child’s campus.  These are unfortunately restricted to 2 adults per child.  This is so we can have maximum numbers of children performing with support from their family and friends.  If you have children in both campuses, then please get tickets for both halves. Everybody is invited to festive refreshments in the interval!


Children will remain at school until the start of the concert and food will be provided for all students.  If your child is going to go home after school please ensure they return by 5.30pm (Yr 1- 4), or 6.45pm (Secondary) and that travel arrangements home after the concert have been made.


Children should wear school uniform with a Christmas twist e.g. tinsel in hair, Santa hat etc.  Children in year 1 should wear either ‘Australian Christmas’ dress (shorts, t-shirt, cork screw hats etc, or Christmas elf costumes).


Please return the consent form with the ticket request form (please click here to download forms) to reception at your child’s campus.  We look forward to welcoming you on 19th December for some festive fun!


Yours faithfully,
