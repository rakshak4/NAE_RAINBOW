Dear Parents,

Tomorrow (Wednesday 17th October) there will be an opportunity for pupils in Year 1-Year 6 to purchase a book written by our visiting author, Katie Dale. There is a very limited amount of books and so these will be sold on a &apos;first come, first served&apos; basis. If you would like your child to purchase one of Katie Dale&apos;s books, please click here to see the attached poster which has a little blurb on each book. Each book will cost 250 rubles and pupils should come to Miss Ruffin&apos;s classroom (on UC) or Miss Salter&apos;s classroom (on LC) between 8.20 â€“ 9.15am only.

If your child would like their book to be signed by the author, then we will give the book directly to the author to be signed and return it to the child by Friday. If they do not wish for it to be signed they may take the book straight away.

Please can we ask for the correct change (250 rubles) only as we will have no change to give the children.

Many thanks.

Miss Ruffin and Miss Salter
