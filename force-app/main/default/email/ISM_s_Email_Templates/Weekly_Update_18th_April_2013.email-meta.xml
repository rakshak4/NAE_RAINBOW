Dear Parents,



Finally, Spring has arrived!



With this in mind please see below:


Summer Uniforms



It has been a warm week and it is tempting therefore to introduce summer uniforms immediately. However the forecast suggests that temperatures may drop slightly next week. With this in mind I would like us to do the following:


For the next two weeks until half term, please exercise common sense on the uniform being worn by our students. While proper uniform is required throughout, please do feel comfortable in making a sensible choice for the prevailing conditions. Shorts or summer dresses on warm days are absolutely fine.


However immediately after the May Break, Summer Uniform will become mandatory for all students. Please consult your parent/student handbook or visit our uniform shop on Lower Campus to ensure that the students do have the proper uniform.


Blazers will still be expected on assembly days according to the normal schedule:


Year 6- 9 Monday

Year 4-5 Thursday

Year 1-3 Friday


Also, if you can begin to collect winter clothes, snow suits and boots from school it will release space in the locker rooms. Thanks very much for your support on these points.


Contact Details



Please could we ask all parents to update your contact details with our admissions team if you have recently changed your phone or email address. It is of course essential that we can contact you at short notice in the event of an emergency.


Paul Seedhouse out of school



I will be travelling for the next two weeks on inspection and recruitment trips. This means that I will have extremely limited capacity to answer emails during this period. In the interim, if any urgent issue arises please do contact the Senior Members of our team (Mr Keach (UC), Mrs Doubleday (LC) or Ms Ramazanova (Administration)) and they will be happy to assist you.


ISM All Stars



We are extremely proud of our growing number of sports teams at ISM. It was confirmed this week that we will have 5 representatives (from 15 selected in total) in the Moscow Youth Basketball League ALL STAR game on April 28th. Congratulations to -



Connor Andrews

Jack Andrews

Min Jun Bae

Ruben Bascha

Ammar Elmazy


This is a great achievement and testament not only to the hard work of these players but also their teammates and coaches in supporting them to this honour. We know they will continue to be great ambassadors for our school.


The International Women`s Club is Calling for Donations (clothes)


Following the success of the autumn collection of donations the International Women`s Club will be collecting donations from ISM parents and staff the next Friday (April 26). The IWC Donations Office collects any unwanted clothes items and passes them on to the charity projects that we support. We can use anything and everything as long as itâ€™s clean and in good condition. If you would like to donate anything you will be able to do so the next Friday, April 26th, between 3 and 4 pm in the canteen of the Upper school campus. In case your children take the school bus you can pass a donation with the bus monitor. We are kindly asking you to ensure that it is of reasonable size (the bus capacity is limited) and is clearly labeled &quot;Donation for IWC&quot;.


In case you have other items to donate we kindly ask you to arrange it with the Donations Office directly. For further information, please go to the website of the International Women`s Club of Moscow at: www.iwcmoscow.ru


Have a wonderful weekend everyone.
