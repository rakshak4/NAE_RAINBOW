Dear Parents,

On Wednesday 18th December ISM will present the 2013 Christmas Concert – ‘The Night Before Christmas’.  Unfortunately due to the increasing number of students at the school there will be a limited number of performer’s places available. If your child wishes to participate, I urge you to log on to the ISM After School Activities website to book a place for your child to attend, and to order audience tickets. Instructions on how to do this can be found at the foot of this letter.

Children in the Primary School (Years 1 – 6) will be performing from 6pm – 7pm in the Upper Campus New Sport Hall.  There will then be refreshments served in the Old Gymnasium, which everybody is invited to attend, before the Secondary School Concert begins at 7.20pm. All students in years 7-9 will have the opportunity to be part of a class or group performance and are strongly encouraged to be involved. There will also be selected students in Year 10 &amp; 11 with specific roles and responsibilities in this years concert. It will last until approximately 8.30pm.

All children will remain at school until the start of the concert and food will be provided for all students. If your child is going to go home after school please ensure that their class teacher has been informed of this and that they return by 5.30pm (Primary), or 7.00pm (Secondary).  Also please make sure that suitable travel arrangements home after the concert have been made, as no buses will be running.

Children should wear school uniform with Christmas accessories e.g. tinsel in hair, Santa hat etc unless stated otherwise below:

Year 1 – Father Christmas outfit or accessories; preferably a bit dirty as he has got stuck up chimney!

Year 2 – Reindeer (brown or black clothes with antlers, or sleigh bells or even a red nose would be perfect).

Year 3 – Please ensure accessories will not interfere with playing the violin.

Year 4 – Father Christmas accessories (hat, beard, boots, sack etc).

Years 5&amp;6 – Any Christmas accessories but also something related to the songs they will have been rehearsing (The Little Saint Nick – Beach Boys).

All secondary students - All secondary students should be in full school uniform (including blazer) for the performance, however Christmas hats and accessories are strongly encouraged!

Please do not forget to book your tickets and we look forward to seeing you for some festive fun soon!

Yours faithfully,

Asta Hodgson

Music Teacher


How To Order Tickets and Secure Performance Places

The following instructions only apply after 5pm on Friday 29th November.  Any orders completed prior to this date will not be processed.

If your child wishes to perform:


Log on the ASA website at http://www.eventbrite.com/org/2966850589
To ensure your child will be performing in the concert please click ‘attend’ for the relevant year group (Years 1 – 9).  Make sure you write their name in the attendee details box.
You should receive an email confirming their place in the concert. Please note that by doing this you are also agreeing for them to stay at school until the concert (unless the class teacher is informed otherwise) and that you will arrange suitable transport arrangements for them to be collected after the concert at 7pm.
Your child will not need a print out of the ticket as the school will automatically receive an electronic register based on ticket sales.
If the website states ‘sold out’ then there are no more spaces for performers in that year group available.

If you would like audience tickets to attend either performance:

Log on to the ASA website at http://www.eventbrite.com/org/2966850589
Please click on whether you would like to attend the Primary Concert or the Secondary Concert.
Tickets orders are limited per family so each child can have a fair chance of someone coming to watch them.  If you have children attending with you who will need a chair please include them in the ticket order.  If you have a toddler or baby who will sit on your knee, please do not include them.
Print out the tickets and bring them with you on the evening of the concert to gain entry.
