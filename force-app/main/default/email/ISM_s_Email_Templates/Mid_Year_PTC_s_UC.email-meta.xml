Dear Parents,


Our second Parent and Teacher Consultations (PTCs) will be held on Tuesday March 4th and Wednesday March 5th from 4:00pm until 6:00pm. This will be an opportunity to discuss your child’s progress and the report you received before half term.


Please note that it is school policy that children do not attend the actual consultation. However, if you are unable to find appropriate supervision then your child may accompany you and he/she will be cared for in the library during your consultation time. Please collect and supervise your child from 3:30pm until the time of your meetings, as teachers will be preparing for consultations.


Your consultation will be with the class teacher in their usual classroom. Please indicate your preferred day and time on the slip (click here to download) and return to school by Tuesday 18th February. Your appointment will then be confirmed in writing. Specialist Teachers will also be available in their classrooms, but will not have a timed schedule.


We look forward to discussing your child’s learning!


Yours sincerely,

Justin Noack

Upper Primary Coordinator
