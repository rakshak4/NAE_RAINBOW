Dear Parents,



Please let us remind you that whenever you send any cash money to school, all payments should be presented in the following way:


- In a sealed envelope with the full name of the student, class, event the payment is for and amount of money inside.



- Wherever possible please give the exact amount. We will issue a receipt once the Accounting Team have received and processed the payment.



This will help us to make sure that all money is safely delivered to the department/member of staff it is intended for.
