Dear Parents,

We would like to take this opportunity to say “Happy New Year” to all families at ISM and we look forward to working hard to support the education of your children in 2013.



Welcome Coffee Mornings



We have several new families joining us for the new term and we will be inviting them and class representatives to join us for some coffee mornings. This will offer the opportunity to meet the community and senior members of the academic team. We would also like to extend this invitation to any parents that would like to join us.



The coffee mornings will take place on the following schedule:



- Lower Primary (Y1-3) Wednesday January 23rd 8:30- 9:30 in LC Canteen



- Upper Campus (Y4- Y10) Wednesday January 30th 8:30- 9:30 in UC Canteen



- Foundation Stage (Nursery and Reception) Thursday January 31st  8:30- 9:30 in LC Canteen



Curriculum Letters- Term Two



An outline of the main topics and themes for Term Two will be sent out next week so that you will know the educational focus in the coming weeks. These will be supported by weekly blurbs in Primary School giving updates on what is happening in class.



Yearbook



I am pleased to confirm that we have a New Year gift for all families- the ISM Yearbook. We will provide a copy for each family to enjoy the memories of last year. The copies will be sent out next week (for families with more than one student we will send it with the eldest). We hope that you enjoy them!



If you thought it was cold here…



Just to confirm that Mr Niall Carton has been working hard travelling south while many of us enjoyed a relaxing break. Please see below if you would like an update on progress or make a donation.

Workshop - Bringing Up Children Abroad


Thursday 24th January 8.30 am - 10.30 am at the Upper Campus Library.


Have you ever worried about how our children are affected by the change of different cities and schools through out their short life? Are we giving them a special gift or a burden?


What is Expat Child Syndrome (ECS)?


What are TCK’s?


Are you planning to move again in the next couple of years?


If you are interested in finding out the answers, please come to the seminar on Thursday.


The session is run by experienced Coach, Claire Geddes, who has dragged her 3 children around 5 countries over the last 12 years! As well as sharing her experiences, official research, facts and figures, Claire is also interested in hearing your views, experience and opinions.


As places will be limited please email in advance to book your seat! Please click here for flyer.


Email Claire Geddes directly with your name and ages of your children:

familygeddes@hotmail.com


If you are interested if attending but unable to come to this date, please email Claire.



Admin team


Please be informed that we have appointed a new school bus coordinator. Her name is Katya Tarasova and she has already been in touch with many of our bus families during the handover period from our previous school bus coordinator, Katie Foster. The email for bus inquires remains the same: bus@internationalschool.ru. If you need to see Katya you can find her on the Front desk of the Upper school campus.


Another new member of admin team has started working on the upper school campus during the Christmas break. Her name is Kate Morozova and she will be in charge of academic resources and catering during Zarina&apos;s maternity leave. Now that we have three Ekaterinas, all working on UC, please do not get confused:


Katie Foster is in charge of the front desk: ekaterina.foster@internationalschool.ru


Katya Tarasova is in charge of buses, facilities maintenance &amp; cleaning: bus@internationalschool.ru


Kate Morozova is in charge of academic resources  and catering: ekaterina.morozova@internationalschool.ru


They all would be happy to assist you with any inquiries via email, phone or in person.
