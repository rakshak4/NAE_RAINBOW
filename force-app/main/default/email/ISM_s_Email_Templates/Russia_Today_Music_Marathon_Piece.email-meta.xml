Dear Parents,

Please make sure you make a note of this: Russia Today are broadcasting a piece on our Music Marathon at around 8.30pm (Russian Time) on Wednesday 14th November on a programme called &apos;Primetime Russia&apos;. The broadcast will only be available to those who can pick up Russia Today through its Russian frequency.

The international version of the channel will not be broadcasting the piece.

Anyone who cannot receive Russia Today through the Russian frequency can watch the piece online at www.rt.com via the link to Primetime Russia.

I hope you enjoy!

Best regards,

The International School of Moscow
