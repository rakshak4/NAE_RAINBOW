Dear Parents, 

We would like to inform you that we have several cases of high fever and vomiting on the Upper Campus this week. 
If your child is feeling unwell and experiencing any of these symptoms, please ensure they remain at home and only return to school once they are well. 

What to look for

•	High fever 
•	Headaches
•	Vomiting
•	Stomach ache

What to do

•	Please follow medical advice, and do not send your child back to school until completely recovered. 
•	Consult your doctor immediately if your child’s temperature exceeds 38.5 degrees.


Please do keep us informed if your child is unable to attend school due to any of these conditions.

Yours sincerely
