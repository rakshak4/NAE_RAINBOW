Dear Parents,

We are rapidly reaching the end of term. While we will be aiming to keep children on task with their work in between events and celebrations there is a lot to look forward to next week.


Year 3 and 5 Productions



I am sure that families in these year groups will be very excited about these performances. Children and staff in both year groups have been working extremely hard in preparation for this week. I am sure that they will go extremely well and be very entertaining for the audience.


Just to clarify the schedule for next week:


Year 3:  Tuesday Morning and Wednesday Evening.

Year 5:  Wednesday Morning and Thursday Evening.


Times will have been confirmed via the year group tutors.


Christmas Celebrations Nursery to Year 5



Friday 14th December is celebration day for these year groups. Hope to see you here to join in the fun and festivities that morning.


Giving Tree Presents



Hopefully all students that wished to collect a gift tag have now brought that home to share with parents. We will respectfully request that no gifts are returned to school until Monday 17th December in order to prevent storage issues.



Please ensure that the tag your child/ren picked from the Giving Tree is securely attached onto the present itself, since the colour tags differentiate where the presents will go to.



Happy shopping!



Arc Christmas Cards



From next week, Christmas Cards in support of the charity ARC will be available for purchase in the reception area of both campuses.


There will be an “honesty box” next to the cards with the price clearly displayed. Please do pop the appropriate amount in the box and take the cards that you have paid for. The cards are fantastic and support an excellent cause! Thank You!


New Menu


From the start of this academic year our students and staff on both campuses have been involved in tasting new dishes and providing their feedback to our catering company. The result of all these efforts is an improved 4-week menu that you can find on our website: http://www.internationalschool.ru/en/school-services/school-lunches.aspx


Donations Collection


The Charity Group of the International Women’s Club would like to thank the generous donation of the parents AND students at the International School of Moscow. After careful sorting of the 62 received bags of donations, the items are still being distributed among the several charity projects of IWC. So far various foster families got a share of the donations as well as the School № 309 for children with mental disabilities. Some of the items went to foreign students families and some to single parents or mixed-racial families that are in need in Moscow and in Ryazan. The Sphera project - that deals with children supported by UNESCO - also benefited from the gathered donations. THANK YOU!


As many parents informed us that they missed the date and/or had not sufficient time for sorting out their belongings we would like to inform you that there will be another opportunity for handing over your donations directly at the school at the end of winter. Until then all donations can be dropped off on Mondays 11.00 – 13.00 directly at the Donations Office at Gruzinsky Pereulok dom 3, apartment 1A.


Recycling



As you may have noticed, there are not many recycling zones in Moscow. Please click here to find out where you can find them to take your sorted rubbish.



Best wishes,
