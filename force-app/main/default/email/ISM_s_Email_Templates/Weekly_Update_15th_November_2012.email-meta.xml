Dear Parents,

Like every Thursday, a quick look at what has been happening and will happen at ISM.

Parent Teacher Consultations



Just a final reminder that we will be holding PTCs next week on Tuesday (20th) and Wednesday (21st) for Primary and Secondary students. We look forward to seeing you there.



Music Marathon



A huge “Thank you” to everyone in the school community that took part in this charity event last week. Not only was it lots of fun but also raised over 500,000 Rubles for Diema’s Dream and Children in Need. You will also be pleased and proud to know that, a part of being on Russia Today, we also made the back page of the newspaper The Moscow Times yesterday! Please click on the link below.

School Menu on our Website



Apologies that the information presently on the website is out of date. Zarina is in the process of completing a new four-week menu that will be in place very soon. Thank you for your patience and we promise to have an accurate menu on the website as soon as it is completed.



Admissions Update



Those of you who have recently visited our Admissions Office, may be aware that we have a new member of our team in place. Richard Cockerill has recently joined as a direct replacement for Dino Vikas.  Dino has been offered the opportunity to lead a school overseas – a lifelong dream. Though he is sad to leave, it is a fantastic opportunity. Dino will be greatly missed by us all but we are very confident that Maaike and Richard will make a great team and maintain the quality of service provided by admissions. Dino will continue to work part-time in the coming weeks to assist a smooth transition.



Change of Dates: Music recitals



We would like to confirm that the Music Recitals for Term One will now take place on the evenings of Tuesday 4th and Wednesday 5th of December instead of the late November dates originally indicated on the website and in the list of events for this term.



Christmas Celebrations



Class Representatives will keep parents informed of how you can support the celebrations taking place in school this year. Foundation Stage and Primary classes will take place on Friday 14th December. Secondary School (Y6-9) celebrations will take place on Thursday 20th December in order to avoid disruption to the secondary timetable and curriculum.  Secondary Class Reps will meet on Tuesday 27th November regarding activities for this new date.



We will also be setting up our Giving Tree again, offering all families an opportunity to purchase a present for the children of our nearby local orphanage. More details will follow very soon.



The Moscow Mellow Divas



Please click here to find out about the Divas&apos; upcoming concerts. (NB - tickets for  December 6th concert at The British Ambassador&apos;s Residence is sold out)



Dome Cinema



Holiday season classics at the Dome Cinema. For more information please click here.



A wonderful end of the week to all!
