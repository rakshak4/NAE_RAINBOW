Dear Parents,



I have absolutely no idea how we have arrived at the last week of this half term. It seems like only yesterday that we were opening the school gates to pupils on the first day of school. Next week is a really exciting week for our school as we welcome some very special visitors to ISM.



ISI Inspection Team



A team of ISI inspectors will be in school from Monday to Thursday next week. We will be welcoming a team of five, led by Mr. Robin Lewis. They will be reviewing the work produced by pupils, interviewing staff and students and of course observing a host of lessons before preparing initial feedback for the school at the end of the week.

Our staff has been working incredibly hard as always but in particular to prepare for this week. I am confident that pupils and staff will perform at their very best and impress the team.

With this in mind there are a couple of things that you as parents can do to help the children to do their best:

Please do ensure that they are well rested and arrive at school on time with a fantastic breakfast behind them.

Please ensure that they are wearing their uniform with pride. Please note that if not wearing PE uniform Blazers should be worn on Monday as we are holding assemblies on this day to welcome our visitors.

Of course once the report is finalized we will ensure that it is made available to all parents as soon as possible.

Football Heroes

Finally a huge “well done” to our U I3s football team, who produced a superb performance this week. Please see the official report below:

A first outing for the U13s bought a fantastic result on Tuesday 8th October.  The Lions travelled to fierce rivals The Anglo American School (AAS) to compete in this mouthwatering clash. AAS made the early breakthrough after some sluggish defending gifted their striker  a free run at goal. However, ISM were quickly back on level terms as Daan Velthius used his &apos;Messi like trickery&apos; to weasel his way to a free kick on the edge of the box. Up stepped the gifted left foot of Gabriel Teixeira who slotted home a wonderful free kick.  After this, the Lions were quickly into their free flowing stride, calving the AAS defence open time after time.  Gabriel found himself unmarked after a clever ball from Daan Velthius to put the Lions into the lead.  Goals from Oliver Coghill, Daniel Mykhaylyuk (2), Nikita Alekseev and Raman Varma (2) sealed an impressive 8 – 3 win away from home. The U13 Lions are now looking forward to showing their ability during the Moscow Super Sevens cup on Saturday 19th October and the spring Moscow Youth Soccer League.

What a great way to end our update this week……
