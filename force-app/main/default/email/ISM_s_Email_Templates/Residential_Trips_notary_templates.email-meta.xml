Dear Parents

As requested by several parents, please find attached sample notary letters for our residential trips to France and Oman. The notary letters you prepare should be very similar to the format in the examples although it is fine if the wording is slightly different. If you present this document at a notary office they should know what to prepare for you.

Template Oman
Template France

Kind regards,
