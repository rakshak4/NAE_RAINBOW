Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.LastName},

In case you are planning to withdraw your child(ren) at the end of the Summer term (5th July, 2013), please be informed of the deadline for submission of the withdrawal notice, in order to receive reimbursement of the Development Contribution fee or an Early notice payback.

Please inform the Admissions department about your intentions by email no later than 8th April, 2013. Once we receive your email, we will then send you an online Withdrawal Form for you to complete, which we will receive automatically once its submitted.

If we do not receive your email by April 8th your request will unfortunately be outside of the reimbursement time frame.

Please contact us should you have any questions in this regard.

Best Regards,

Admissions Team
The International School of Moscow
World Class Education
