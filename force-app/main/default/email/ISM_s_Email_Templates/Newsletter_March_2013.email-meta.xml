Dear Parents,



The latest newsletter is now online:

Instrumental Tuition Summer Term (Y1 - Y10 parents)



Please (click here) to find the request form and information regarding Individual music lessons for the summer term.


Please understand that the logistics of rearranging a timetable for late applications means that we can no longer accept students on to the timetable once it is in place.


With this in mind, please ensure that the form with payment is returned to school (Reception or Finance Office) by THURSDAY 11TH APRIL to avoid disappointment.


If you require any further information about the instrumental program, please do not hesitate to contact James Langford.


Best regards,



The International School of Moscow
World Class Education
