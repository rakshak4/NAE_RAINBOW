Dear Parents,


Happy New Year and welcome to Spring Term at ISM! We’ll be looking to build on the momentum of Autumn Term and continue the children’s development. We always appreciate and value the support provided at home by you and we look forward to this positive partnership continuing over the coming term.


Over the coming term, I would encourage you to actively support the children in maintaining daily reading habits. They should read aloud regularly and ensure they make comments in their Reading Record book. We also encourage you to discuss your child’s writing and Maths homework with them. Apart from building new skills, reminders about the basics are always helpful! Please click here to download the curriculum overview.
