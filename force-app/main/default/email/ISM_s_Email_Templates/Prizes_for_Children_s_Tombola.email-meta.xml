Dear Parents

For this year&apos;s Family Fun Day we are having a tombola as well as a raffle.

We have prizes for the raffle but not enough for the tombola. The tombola is a stall just for children, they choose a ticket and then if it matches one of the prizes on the table, they get it immediately, if not they get a consolation prize e.g. lolly, pencil, rubber etc.

The idea is that children get the immediate satisfaction of a prize and don&apos;t have to wait until the end like the raffle. Also all prizes in the tombola are child orientated and not too expensive!

WE NEED MORE PRIZES!!!!

Please send into school, any children&apos;s prizes. They can be for any age from 4 to 16! Donations should be new. This is a great opportunity to get rid of any unused gifts, toys, books, games, make up, sports equipment etc.

Please send in them in ASAP to the reception desk at school so we can start putting tickets on them!

Thank you in advance

Best wishes

The Raffle and Tombola Team
