Speech Day – 2013



Our annual ISM Speech Day is for many members of our community a highlight of the school year. It offers an opportunity to review the year and celebrate the successes of our students and of course our school.



I am pleased to announce that we can confirm the venue and arrangements for our annual Speech Day for 2013. This year we will be returning to our old home - The Marriott Grand Hotel on Tverskaya Street in the centre of Moscow.


Due to the growth of our school community we are no longer able to accommodate all students, staff and families together at one event. Those of you that have attended previous ISM Speech Days will have experienced the largest hotel ballrooms in Moscow being packed to the rafters.


Having consulted with hotel management, class representatives and staff we have decided on the following structure for this year:


Thursday July 4th 6 - 7pm: Upper Campus Speech Day (Years 4 - 10)


Friday July 5th 10 - 11am: Lower Campus Speech Day (Reception - Year 3)


Obviously it is a pity that the whole of the school body cannot be together but the logistical challenges mean that this is not possible. This arrangement also has several advantages:


-     It will allow us ample time to celebrate students in each area of the school without the event becoming too long.



-     The older students will enjoy the opportunity afforded by an evening event and parents will be able to attend with less time away from work.



-     The younger students will enjoy a morning event that will suit their age better.



-     The hotel will be able to cater better for these events making the celebrations more comfortable for all.


For those families with students on both sites, we hope that by holding one in the evening it will not place too much pressure on parents that do have work commitments.


Also please note that Nursery Graduation will still take place on Thursday 4th July on the Lower Campus at 10am.


In order for students and staff to be able to prepare for and attend the evening event, ISM will close at noon on Thursday July 4th.


While more details will follow nearer the event, I felt that it was important to share these dates with you at an early stage so that if you are making plans for the summer you can take this into consideration.


Leaving Time on Friday March 29th



Just to confirm that tomorrow is an early finish for the end of term.



Students should be ready for departure at 11:50 on LC and 12:00 on UC.


Please ensure that you are aware of these times and make suitable arrangements to collect or receive your children.


We hope that you have a wonderful Easter holiday and we are looking forward to seeing you on your return to school on Monday 8th April.


Best regards,
