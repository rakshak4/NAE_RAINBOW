Dear Parents,

The date to bring the presents to put under the Giving Tree is Monday 17th December, unfortunately we have nowhere to store them until then.

Those families who are not going to be here during that week are welcome to bring their presents to the Admissions office on the Upper Campus.



Please ensure that the tag your child/ren took home is securely attached onto the present itself, since the colour tags differentiate where the presents will go to.



Thank you for your support.


Have a lovely weekend!
