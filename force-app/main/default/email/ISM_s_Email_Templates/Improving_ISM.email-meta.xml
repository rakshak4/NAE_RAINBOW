Dear Parents,

On September 9th, you received a summary of the annual parent survey from our Chairman Mr. Stewart Fry as well as more recently the report from our ISI inspection. Please do contact admissions if you have not received either document and they will send them again. Both documents clearly identify many achievements of our school of which we should all be very proud. (Please click here to download the certificate recently received from ISI confirming the contents of the report).

At this point of the year the Senior Leadership of the school always reflects not only upon achievements but also aspects of our school for improvement.

We use information from several sources to ensure that we focus on the most important aspects of our school every academic year:


Parent surveys and feedback
Pupil interviews, student council suggestions and end of year feedback forms
School Improvement Plans (SIP) from every department in the school
Evaluation report of the school against the BSF charter objectives by a visiting Head Teacher from within the foundation
Progress and achievement data of our pupils
Review of progress against targets from the previous annual SIP

This year, we also have an ISI report that is particularly useful as it provides an objective, measured summary of the performance of our school. I am therefore delighted that ISI recognised The International School of Moscow to be excellent in all aspects.


However, it is our nature not to stand still and congratulate ourselves too much. While we have been recognised as an excellent school, our aspiration is to improve further and offer a truly world class education.

With this in mind, I wanted to share some of the key areas that have been identified through the various channels of feedback in which we aim to improve:

Feedback from ISI

ISM was given two recommendations that we have already been reflecting upon and plotting a course of action:

1. Ensure that robust programmes are in place to support Able, Gifted and Talented (AG&amp;T) students and pupils with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND).

We had already recognised, prior to inspection that this was an area for development and had made a full time appointment of a Learning Support Coordinator (Ms. Levine) for 2013-14. She has already begun to provide individual support and where appropriate developed Individual Education Plans for pupils with moderate SEND. Our admissions policy remains to only enrol pupils that we are confident that we can fully support. We will review the progress made in this aspect of school at the end of the academic year before agreeing objectives in 2014-15.


With regards AG&amp;T students the school ethos has demanded that our most able students are challenged in lessons on a daily basis. However we have lacked a coherent policy and structured programme to support this aim. This will be addressed and an action plan developed to ensure a structured approach is in place for 2014-15. I am pleased to report that the BSF board has agreed to additional staffing provision to meet this recommendation.

2. Consolidate consistency in marking and assessment and incorporate effective analysis of data into staff planning

With this recommendation in mind we are taking the following actions:



Our future management structure will incorporate key members of staff who will be responsible for tracking data and planning appropriate interventions.
Our gathering of externally marked data will be expanded to include the CEM tests www.cem.org at certain key milestones throughout the school.
Assessment and marking policies will reviewed and improved
Evaluation of marking and assessment by teachers will be a key focus of annual teacher appraisal and performance management

Feedback from Parents, Pupils and Staff


Facilities


We agree with parent and pupil feedback that we must ensure that facilities grow alongside our body of students and we are committed to doing so. This requires careful management of the number of students able to enter the school and continued development with the main actions below:
The opening of our new Upper Campus Gymnasium, additional classrooms and outside sports areas has improved the educational and social experience of our pupils. We will continue to develop the Upper Campus site with these objectives in mind.
There will be no further horizontal growth (adding classes to current year groups) on our present sites unless the facilities can fully support it.
There will be continued vertical growth (Year 12 and 13) enabling our pupils to complete A Levels at ISM and secure places at universities worldwide.
We will employ careful management of the number of Nursery and Reception classes to ensure that growth is sustainable.
We will seek opportunities to extend and improve outside facilities on our Lower Campus.

New Sites


We recognise that our current sites do have limitations and want to develop additional facilities in convenient locations for our families. This is a huge challenge in Moscow but we are actively seeking opportunities to do so.

We will open an additional EYFS and Key Stage One site in the Rosinka complex in 2014. This will provide some additional spaces in a key area of need for our community. We also hope for and will of course announce further developments at the earliest possible opportunity.

Advanced ‘A’ Levels

It is crucial to us that pupils have the opportunity to complete their Secondary education at ISM. We will begin A Level courses in 2014. We will achieve a high quality 6th form (Year 12 and 13) experience for pupils by:


Offering a diverse and varied set of options to support career ambitions and university entry
Providing generous, high quality staffing levels enabling small group sizes and individual attention for students
Giving excellent support for entrance to university via careers guidance, works experience and effective application and interview support

School services


We are pleased that pupils, parents and staff have recognised improvements in both the bus and lunch services. We also recognise there is still more work to do. In both aspects we will continue to review standards and work hard to improve the service provided. Our objectives are to provide a safe and efficient bus service and to provide pupils with lunches that they eat and enjoy each and every day. We will continue to actively involve the student councils across the school to develop dishes that are popular and healthy for our pupils.

Objectives set by the BSF Board

Enriched Curriculum

The BSF board demands that we offer an enriched curriculum in line with our School Charter (see the governance section of our website). With this in mind we will focus on the following in our next School Improvement Plan:


Developing an effective mentoring programme at Secondary school level that will support the academic and pastoral growth of all pupils.
Reviewing and improving the ICT curriculum in line with guidelines from the UK to incorporate topics such as coding, robotics and graphic design and ensuring that mobile devices are used to maximum effect in learning.
Ensure that all pupils enjoy enhanced opportunities to enjoy music and sports as part of their curriculum and extra curricular opportunities at ISM.
The learning experience is enriched with visiting experts to the school.

On the last point, I am very aware that we have many talented parents in our community with great expertise in diverse fields such as business, travel, fashion, music, sports, art, photography, journalism, media and probably many more.


I will be very keen to explore with you, our parents, how we might be able to bring that expertise into our school and enrich our curriculum.

In Summary

In summary, we have clear focus and direction in how we can make ISM a better school and we are committed to doing so. The BSF board have been generous in their willingness to support these areas of development at the recent annual board meeting and are committed to achieving the highest aspirations for our schools not only in Moscow but worldwide.

Thank you for your feedback and continued support and I look forward to leading the improvement of our school in 2014-15.
