Dear Parents,

Just a reminder of the Workshop taking place this Thursday 24th January 8.30 am - 10.30 am at the Upper Campus Library about bringing up children abroad.


Have you ever worried about how our children are affected by the change of different cities and schools through out their short life? Are we giving them a special gift or a burden?


What is Expat Child Syndrome (ECS)?


What are TCKâ€™s?


Are you planning to move again in the next couple of years?


If you are interested in finding out the answers, please come to the seminar on Thursday.


The session is run by experienced Coach, Claire Geddes, who has dragged her 3 children around 5 countries over the last 12 years! As well as sharing her experiences, official research, facts and figures, Claire is also interested in hearing your views, experience and opinions.


As places will be limited please email in advance to book your seat! Please click here for flyer.


Email Claire Geddes directly with your name and ages of your children:

Best regards,
