Dear Parents,

Could you please check that you, the driver or guardian of your child(ren) have not taken a school bag by mistake. Please find the details below:

&apos;Its the standard school bag, with a small &apos;A&apos; in black biro at the top of the orange stripe and a pink keyring with 4 cat pictures on it, attached to the big ring for the strap, at the side of the bag&apos;. It has a raincoat inside and glasses in the front pocket.

If you have it, could you please bring it to school tomorrow and leave it at the lower campus front desk.

Many thanks for your attention.

Best regards,

The International School of Moscow
World Class Education
