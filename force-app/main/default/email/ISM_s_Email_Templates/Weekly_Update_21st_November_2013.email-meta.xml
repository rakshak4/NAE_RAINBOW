Dear Parents,

I am acutely aware that you have received a lot of Email communication this week. Apologies for the volume of correspondence, but hopefully you see this as positive as we approach this very busy time of year. You will be aware that we are supporting three fundraising/charity actions at the moment. Apologies for that and please only contribute to a level that you are comfortable with.

Typhoon Relief Fund

Tomorrow is our cake bake sale on both sites. If you do wish to contribute cakes, they should arrive at school first thing in the morning so that organisers can set up.

Please do ensure that students who wish to buy a cake have appropriate small notes as we will have limited change.

The donations box will remain on both sites until the end of the school day tomorrow.

Several parents have asked if they can make a donation directly to a school bank account in Manila.

Remittance in: PHP (Philippine Peso)

Account Name: The King&apos;s School Manila, Inc.

Account Number: 1921-1162-72

Bank Swift Code: BOPIPHMM

Bank Name: Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI)

Bank Address: G/F, Net One Centre Building, 26th Street corner 3rd Avenue, Bonifacio Global City, Taguig, Philippines

In order to track these payments, if you do make a donation to account, please do the following. Send an email to the Headmaster Mr. Peter Lindsay peter.lindsay@kings.org.ph stating the amount and date of the payment.

It is worth sharing with you that one of our staff from the Philippines was almost reduced to tears by the schools efforts, it means that much to them. Thank you so much for your support.

Movember

I understand that there has been growing concern within the community that our staff dress code now requires all male teachers to grow a handlebar moustache. Allow me to reassure you that this is not the case. In fact many of our male teachers are growing facial hair to raise money for male cancers.

Next Friday, (November 29th) marks the last school day of &apos;Movember&apos; and will be the day when some of our male teachers throw caution to the wind and allow students to shave off their beautifully crafted growth!

If the children would like to have the opportunity to shave their teachers they will need to donate to the &apos;Movember&apos; fund and their name will be placed in a hat. The winners will be drawn out in assembly for Lower Primary and at break time for Upper Primary and Secondary.

The children will also be able to buy moustache shaped cookies at break time and there will be moustache face painting for a donation. If children have a fake moustache they would rather wear then that is ok.

If students or parents wish to contribute to the fundraising, please send children in with a donation next Friday.

Secondary School Information Evening

Please be reminded that the Secondary School Information Evening about National Curriculum Levels, (I)GCSE grades and report grades will take place on Tuesday November 26th at 6pm.

Christmas Divas

The Moscow Mellow Divas will be performing &apos;Gilbert &amp; Sullivan&apos;s Christmas&apos; on the 4th and 5th December. This promises an evening of comic opera and Christmas cheer. For more information, please click here to download the flyer.

Christmas Celebrations

Please do be aware that the Children will be celebrating Christmas in school on Thursday the 19th of December. Class reps will be working with teachers to organize morning activities for the students. Please do volunteer to support your class reps in making sure all students have a wonderful day!

The Christmas Concert will take place on the evening of Wednesday 18th December to which all parents are invited. Please put that date in your diary and more details will follow from the expressive arts team soon.


Living with Teenagers Abroad Workshop - Fully Booked

The response to the seminar has been great! For those of you attending, we hope you find it informative and useful. Please be reminded that there will be another workshop on the 6th December - Trailing Spouses. More information to come.

Newsletter

The second newsletter of the year is now up on our school website and can be found at the following link:

Highlights of the November edition include the highlights of Story Week; school trips to the Bolshoi Theatre, Madrid, London and Malaysia; student poetry contributions and the latest sports roundup.

Have a great weekend and start retrieving the winter kit. Our first snowfall has been predicted for Monday!
