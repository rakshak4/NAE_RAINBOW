Initial reports will be sent home with the students this Friday. They are an initial report with main objective of identifying progress being made at an early stage. More detailed curriculum reports will follow later in the year as more work is produced. Do be aware that parent/teacher consultations will follow (see dates above) once After School Activities Programme for this term has been completed.  Opportunities to set up appointments will follow on from the reports.



Remembrance Day



We will be offering the opportunity to commemorate those who died in conflict from all nations by selling poppies on the Upper Campus from next week. Students/parents may make a voluntary contribution to the appeal and purchase a poppy to wear at school. Please use the link below to gain further information on how the funds raised will be used.

Spring term invoices


Spring term invoices will be sent out on Friday, November 16. If you need to receive the invoice earlier in order to meet the payment deadline (December 15) please contact Marina Urmanova, our Invoicing Manager, at isminvoicing@britishschools.co.uk.



Swimming pool



If you, your nannies or drivers would like to help your child(ren) get ready before and after swimming lessons or during the Swimming Gala, please note that you do NOT need to order a pass in advance. Just let the security at the swimming pool know that you are from ISM.
