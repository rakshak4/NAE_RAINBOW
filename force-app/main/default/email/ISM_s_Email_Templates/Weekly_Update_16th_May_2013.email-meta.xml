Dear Parents,


Welcome back for our final half term of the year. It promises to be a busy term full of activity beginning with our Secondary Music Concert tonight.



Another addition to the ISM community



There must be something in the water….


James and Marina are the happy parents of a healthy baby boy, born on Monday at 3:05 pm.

He is still to be named but “Larry” is the early front-runner!


James of course is still finding time to lead our Upper School Music Concert tonight, such is his commitment to his students and our school.


Summer Uniform



It is great to finally greet the warm weather and students have looked very smart in their summer uniforms this week. In relation to this, can we please make the following requests to ensure the comfort of our students.



- Children should bring sun hats to school and wear sun cream on hot days

- No sandals for school please as this does have health and safety issues

- Please ensure that all students have water bottles every day as they will get very thirsty

- Year 1 &amp; 2 girls in summer dresses should be in white socks.


Thanks for your attention on these points



Family Fun day



We are just over a week away from our major community social event of the year. We look forward to seeing you between 11am and 3pm on Saturday the 25th of May on our Lower Campus. Please bring a picnic, a blanket and enjoy an afternoon in the sunshine (we hope) with our community. Raffle tickets will be on sale from next week.



Cash


We would like to remind you that any cash payments sent to the school should be in a sealed envelope with the Name, Class, and what the payment is for clearly stated on the envelope.

Diema’s Dream – a thank you



A message of thanks from this worthwhile charity and a lovely way to end this update…



Dear ISM!



We are happy to inform you that the charity donation of 270,000 roubles raised through the charity Music Marathon at The International School of Moscow on November 8 has been used to purchase a MOTOmed viva1 movement therapy machine for Anna Izotova, a child with disability, born in 2006.



Thanks to your support, Anna will be able to practice at home every day using the equipment to develop her walking skills, thus improving the quality of her life! Anna’s family is certain that with the use of this movement therapy machine Anna will be able to learn to walk by herself.



The total cost of the movement therapy machine is 314,072.00 roubles. Paying for such an expensive machine would have been impossible for a low-income family had it not been for your generosity and the help of other donors. Anna and her mother pass on their warmest words of gratitude to you!



Diema&apos;s Dream Fund would like to take this opportunity to thank you for supporting the &quot;Take a Step&quot; Charity program! For more information please click here.

From the bottom of our hearts we wish all of the staff members and students of The International School of Moscow        health, prosperity and success.

Best regards,

The International School of Moscow
