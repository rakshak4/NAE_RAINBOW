Dear Parents,

We hope that you have enjoyed the first week back. There are just a few snippets of information to digest this week.

ICT E- Safety information event- Tuesday 11th March

A final reminder that we are offering a second and final opportunity for all families to learn more about the challenges and solutions to helping children to use technology safely at home and in school.

This will take place next Tuesday in the Upper Campus canteen.

Following on from the recent article in our newsletter, I would encourage all parents to attend this informative session.

Refreshments will be served in the Upper Campus canteen from 8:20, and the event will begin at 8:45.

Avoiding Waste- plastic cups in school

We began the process of reducing the use of plastic cups at ISM in the last academic year. For some time, students and staff have been encouraged to bring a personal water bottle to school so that plastic cups do not need to be used.


From Monday March 17th we will remove all plastic cups from the water units placed around the school. The only exception will be in the reception areas of the school where visitors will of course require access to water.

With this in mind, please can you ensure that all students come to school each day with their own re-useable water bottle and names clearly on the item. They should be returned and washed at home regularly of course. (We would suggest daily)

In school, we will continue to ensure that water is available for students at all times and encourage them to drink regularly. The water units will remain fully operational for this purpose. We will of course share with students the importance and relevance of this action for the environment.

We appreciate your support with this small but important action.

Summer Term Fees



Please be informed that the invoices for the Summer Term 2014 will be issued on the 10th March and will be sent home with the students. Please, check your child&apos;s blue folder/school bag to ensure that you have received the invoice and accompanying documents. If you have not received the invoice, please contact Marina Urmanova at isminvoicing@britishschools.co.uk.

If your child(ren)&apos;s school fees are paid by a company, then you will NOT receive the invoice. All company invoices have been sent directly to the payer.



Please, note that Summer Term fees must be paid by 1st April.

If you have any questions or need any assistance, please contact Marina Urmanova directly at isminvoicing@britishschools.co.uk


Recruitment trip to UK

Paul Keach and Paul Seedhouse will be back in school on Monday following on from a successful trip to UK. We look forward to sharing the details of our new staff later in the year as the team is completed.

Information to Parents- Parent Portal

Following on from the previous update, we are reorganising our lines of communication in order to make them more efficient. I will share the key elements of our new communications policy in the next update. Teachers are already using the portal to share information with you and therefore it is essential that you do begin to use the portal on a regular basis.

However, we are aware that some families have not yet logged on to the system. It is possible therefore that some parents may not have yet viewed the recent Early Years and Primary reports that were presented their prior to the half term break. Do understand that no printed copies of these reports will be sent home from school and therefore it is essential that you use the portal in order to read about the progress and achievements of your children.

The Secondary reports due at the end of this month will be released in the same way.

We would like to take this opportunity to encourage you to access the portal using the information sent out to you previously from the admissions team and if for any reason you are unable to do so, contact them immediately. By doing this you will ensure that you receive all information provided by the school.

We hope that you have a wonderful weekend.
