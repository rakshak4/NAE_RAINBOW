Dear Parents,


Here at ISM we take pride in celebrating the cultural heritage of all of our students and this is never more evident than during our International Week celebrations.


This year we will be following a very similar format to last year’s successful week. The Secondary students will split into houses for three days in order to prepare some pieces to present to the rest of the Secondary Phase. Each house will focus on one particular country and they will have several tasks to present.


Students will present in the following categories:



- A piece of artwork
- A reenactment of a famous scene from the country’s history
- A video presentation about the country
- Teach a basic aspect of the language
- A Skype interview with a school in their country (if possible)
- A traditional food dish (prepared at home)


We have chosen a variety of countries that we feel the students are not familiar with and can therefore put their research skills to full use, and also countries where we have school links available. The countries have been assigned to houses as follows:


Normans – Brazil

Romans – Tanzania

Saxons – Uzbekistan

Vikings – Malaysia


We welcome parental support in helping the children to prepare for the event at home and as an additional task we encourage the children to try their hand at making some traditional dishes from these countries, in order to share with the other students during lunchtime on Wednesday 31st October.


The performances will take place on the afternoon of Thursday 1st November, and we welcome all parents to attend to view the presentations.  Unfortunately we are limited with space so we may not be able to accommodate parents for all performances, however we can ensure that there is space for you to view the performance for your child’s house


The performances will run according to the following schedule:


12:45 – 1:15 Romans

1:20 – 1:40 Normans

1:40 – 2:00 Break

2:05 – 2:35 Vikings

2:40 – 3:10 Saxons


Finally, if any parents have links to or first hand knowledge of the countries being studied, and would like to come in during the research days to work with students, please do let me know and I will arrange for a convenient time for this to happen.


Yours faithfully,



Michelle Hamilton
