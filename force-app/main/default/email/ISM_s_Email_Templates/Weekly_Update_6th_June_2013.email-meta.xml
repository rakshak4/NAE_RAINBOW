Dear Parents,


It has been a very busy time for our students in the community this week. Apart from the educational visits taking place in various parts of Moscow and the residential week on the horizon we have been out and about during the weekend….



Family Fun Day



I wanted to say a big thank you to everyone that supported this great event last weekend. It was a wonderful day helped enormously by the weather. (A far cry from last year!)



Well done to all class representatives who did a marvelous job in leading the organisation of the event as well as all school staff who worked very hard on the day.



The good news is that in addition to a great social event, we have also raised a great deal of money for the Open Art Theatre Company that performed so well on the day.



We raised 280 050 rubles through the raffle and, 56,585 rub from the silent auction bids making a grand total of 336, 635 rubles.

Thank you to everyone on the achievements of the day.



On another note, please click here for an updated list of unclaimed raffle prizes and ticket numbers. Hopefully you haven’t thrown your tickets away yet!



We found a gold and silver chain with a cross. If you are missing this item, please go to the lower campus front desk to claim it.



COBIS Games



Congratulations to all Year 5 and 6 students that represented ISM at the recent COBIS games held in the Netherlands.  It was a tough competition in which our students competed with schools from Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

The students behaved and performed in exemplary fashion and gave their very best in the disciplines of Football, Basketball and Athletics. Many individuals achieved personal best performances during the weekend. However the competition was fierce and has given us new benchmarks to aim for in future years.



The PE team is already planning the preparation for next year’s event!



Diema’s Dream Fundraising Ball



I was extremely proud to attend this great event on Saturday although it did involve a “Clark Kent” style change of clothing after leaving the Family Fun Day.

Our Senior Choir performed a stirring rendition of “Rescue Me” following on from incredibly confident and mature solo performances by Anna Martin and Katie Guryeva.



Our Year Nine and Ten students (+ Lisa Guryeva) then assisted a lead auctioneer from Christies in presenting pieces at the bidding stage, helping to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for this worthy cause.



Our students were great ambassadors for the school and they maintained the support we offer to this wonderful charity. I would also like to also thank Tony Watkins  (parent of Aleena and Sophie) for arranging this opportunity.


Tottenham Hotspurs return to Moscow



We have been hosting coaches from this top English Premier League Team again this week.



Our students have been bounding to the sessions excited at the opportunity to work with experts of the highest quality. It has been fantastic to see so much enjoyment and progress being achieved session by session.

Sessions have focused on skill development, enjoyment and opportunities to play small-sided games on a daily basis.



We even enjoyed a visit from the Russia Today cameras covering the event!



End of Year Absences



Obviously we encourage all students to attend school until the end of the school year. However, we are also mindful that there may be exceptional circumstances for some families that may prevent this.

Teachers are currently planning end of term events and activities with many of them (including productions and Speech Day) reliant on student participation and family support.



With this in mind, please do confirm with form tutors immediately if your children will be leaving school before the end of term and the reason why so that they can plan accordingly. Your support in this will really help our staff to ensure a smooth and productive end to the year.


Thank you and a wonderful weekend to all.
