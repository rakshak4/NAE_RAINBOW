Dear Parents,


We hope that you are enjoying the final stages of the summer break. Our first day of the 2013-14 academic school year is only a week away of course. With this in mind we wanted to offer you a brief update.


School Uniform



This week, the uniform shop will be open from 9am - 4pm. Please do take this opportunity to organize school uniform this week and before school opens if possible. If students do not have their school uniform by the first day we please ask that you do not attempt to purchase the uniform on the first day but instead dress your son/daughter smartly for the first day or two. You will be able to purchase the uniforms from Tuesday 27th August onwards, between 8am and 4pm.


Please note, that all students will be expected to wear summer uniform on the first day. Should any items not be available we do of course understand and request that you dress students in something similar that you have at home. We are experiencing a delay with one or two specific items/sizes from our suppliers and apologise for any inconvenience caused.


Parent/Student Handbooks


Please find a digital version of the parent student handbooks below. If for some reason you can’t open the links, please do contact the admissions department directly.


EYFS (Nursery and Reception) (please click here)

Primary (Year 1 to year 6) (please click here)

Secondary (Year 7 to year 11) (please click  here)


The handbook is a very useful guideline, particularly for new families and will assist parent and students in gaining a clear picture of our school ethos, expectations and procedures.


A hard copy will also be sent home with students on their first day at school. Please do refer to it as the information inside is designed to ensure that you are well informed on life at ISM.


In addition, the key school Health, Safety and Welfare policies are posted on our website for your reference. Once school opens, a complete set of school policies is also held in reception area by the front desk on both sites should you wish to refer to them.


Teaching Staff



Our team will reassemble this week to complete preparations for the new academic year.



Photographs and information for every staff member will be available on our website before the end of this week. We will of course notify you when they are in place.


First day procedures



The big day fast approaches and we know that the children (and parents) will be excited and perhaps a little anxious about their first day. Please note that our intention is to ensure that the students face as little stress as possible and settle into class with the minimum of fuss. With this in mind, while parents not using the bus service are of course welcome, we aim to get children to classes and settled with their their classmates and teachers as quickly and calmly as possible. The first morning is designed to establish normal routines within classrooms at an early stage so that all children feel at home and comfortable. There are therefore no special induction activities that parents need to attend on that first day. We will of course give a clear detailed outline of how the day will be organized in the parent weekly update on Thursday.


We are looking forward to greeting the children and ensuring that they have a great first day and meeting all parents new and established in the first few weeks of school in our planned coffee mornings and “Meet the Teacher” evenings.


We hope that you enjoy the last week of the summer break.



Kind regards,



Admissions Team
