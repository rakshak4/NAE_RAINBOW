Dear Parents,




ISM Family Golf Championship



On Sunday 23rd June ISM will be holding a family golf competition. The competition will take place between 8am and 11am on a short 4-hole course close to school.



Similar to last year a pupil from ISM will partner an adult family member taking alternate golf shots. Each partnership will be allocated a specific tee time and one round should take approximately 50minutes. The lowest gross score will take the title! If your child is keen to play but has no family member to play alongside then fear not for there are many members of staff itching to compete!


Itâ€™s a fantastic day enjoyed by all and I would love nothing more than for you to join us!!


A letter will be sent out at a later date but at this stage please could you email Elizabeth Salter (Elizabeth.salter@internationalschool.ru) as soon as you can to confirm interest as the venue are keen to know numbers.



Family Fun Day




As you know it is just over a week until the ISM Family Fun Day so we wanted to let you know more about the exciting things on offer at the event.

Please click here to download the programme of the day detailing the stalls, shows, raffle prizes and attractions. A paper copy will also be sent home with your child(ren).

We have a charity raffle with some fantastic prizes. Raffle tickets are on sale from Monday at both upper and lower campus receptions during morning break and at the end of the school day (see programme for ticket prices). Raffle tickets will also be for sale at the event. You can also bid for a piece of &apos;class art&apos; in the silent auction, so please ensure you bring cash on the day!

Please note that there will be only light complimentary refreshments available so you should bring a picnic for your own family, plus a picnic blanket and any plates, napkins and cutlery you require. Please do not bring gazebos or any furniture as space is limited. Moderate amounts of wine or beer are permitted but please drink responsibly.

We are all keeping our fingers crossed for a dry day. However, if we are unlucky enough to have a lot of rain, the event will be cancelled as we are not permitted to move inside for safety reasons. If the event has to be cancelled, we will communicate this via email on the morning of Saturday 25th May.

Please make sure you have Saturday 25th May in your diary. We look forward to seeing you for a day of fun!


Autumn Term Invoices



Please be informed that the invoices for the next Autumn term will be emailed and/or put into your child&apos;s blue folders on May 27th. If you have any queries please contact Marina Urmanova at isminvoicing@britishschools.co.uk.


Have a great weekend,
