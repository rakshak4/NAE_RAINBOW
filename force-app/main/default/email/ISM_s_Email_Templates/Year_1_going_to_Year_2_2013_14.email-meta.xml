Dear Parents,


We hope you are well and looking forward to a well deserved summer break.


We are now busy organising our classes for the next academic year and just wanted to notify you that you may see some changes in classes when we provide you with the class lists next week. Please note that these changes will take into consideration nationality, native English speakers, gender, ability level, house and friendship groups.



We are sure that we have managed to find the best balance in each class and look forward to a fantastic academic year 2013/14.




Best regards,



Admissions department
