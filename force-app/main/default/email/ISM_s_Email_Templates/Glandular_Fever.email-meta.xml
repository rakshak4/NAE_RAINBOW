Dear Parents,

We have had a single case of infectious mononucleosis (Glandular fever) on the Upper Campus.

The main symptoms are:


- extreme tiredness

- sore throat

- Fever 38 +

- swollen glands in the neck

Glandular fever is not usually a serious threat to a person&apos;s health, but can be unpleasant and last several weeks.

If your child has one or several of the above symptoms he/she should stay at home and checked by a doctor. A blood test is necessary to confirm if your child has infectious mononucleosis.

Please do let us know if your child has a confirmed case of the virus.

Best Regards

The ISM nursing team
