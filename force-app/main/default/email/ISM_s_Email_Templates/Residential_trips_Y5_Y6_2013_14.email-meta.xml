Dear Parents,

Please be informed that during the 2013-14 academic year, Residential Trips for Years 5 and 6 will once again be scheduled in June, after Assessment Week.

Although Secondary students have Residential Week rescheduled to take place earlier in the year, Upper Primary has chosen to continue with our late-year scheduling. We feel that this will allow students to gain maximum benefit from the camps, by ensuring that they travel with teachers and peers with whom they are highly familiar. Considering that for many children this will be their first trip away from home and family, we anticipate that traveling later in the school year will reduce some of the typical stresses and thus allow them to focus more on the social and personal challenge aspects of the camps.

Looking towards the future, we will monitor feedback from Secondary to consider the benefits of an early Residential. However, we wanted to reassure you that for the coming year, our schedule remains quite consistent with previous years.

Regards,

Justin Noack
