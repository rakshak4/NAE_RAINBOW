Dear Parents,

Just a little update regarding the arrival time of the children on Friday.

Please make sure that you are at school to collect your child(ren) at 4pm on Friday. This is not because we are cutting the itinerary short, we over estimated time travel and the journey to Ethnomir didn&apos;t take half the time as expected.

Best regards,

The International School of Moscow
