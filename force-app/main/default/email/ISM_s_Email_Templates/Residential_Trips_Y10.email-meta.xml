Dear Year 10 Parents,


Before Christmas communication was sent out regarding our 2013 residential trips programme. A letter accompanied the information asking for you to indicate whether your child would or would not be attending the residential trip.



I have received back several forms and have spoken directly to the students who did not bring back the form.


I regret to inform you that at this point in time we only have a handful of students who have confirmed that they would like to attend the trip. Unfortunately, with this small number, it will not be possible for the trip to go ahead as it would involve a significant increase in costs for each student who wishes to attend.


As a school we are very happy with the well rounded programme of trips that we have now established and Karelia will be a trip that will run next academic year and in future years to come. I would like to give you one more opportunity to reconsider your decisions and make it clear that the students will not be offered an alternative trip and that if the trip does not go ahead, they will be expected to attend school as normal and IGCSE classes will continue in a modified format. If you decide that you would like your child to attend, could you please inform me by Tuesday, 22nd January.


Please do let me know if you have any questions about the information above. You can contact me at michelle.heckford@internationalschool.ru


Yours faithfully,


Michelle Hamilton
