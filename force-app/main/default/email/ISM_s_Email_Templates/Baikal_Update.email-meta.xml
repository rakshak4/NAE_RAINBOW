Dear Year 9 Parents,

We&apos;ve received news from Mr. Tome. The group have arrived safely and all is well. There are phones available for the children, so they will have the chance to contact you directly every morning, should they wish to do so.

We will, of course, keep you posted should anything change.

Kind regards,

Admissions Department
