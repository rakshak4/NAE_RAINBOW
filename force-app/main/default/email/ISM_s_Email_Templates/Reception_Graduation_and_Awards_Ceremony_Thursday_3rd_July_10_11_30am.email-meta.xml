Dear Parents,

This year, we are holding our Reception Graduation ceremony in our Lower Campus Hall. All Reception students are of course expected to attend, as it is the final session of the academic year for this year group.

This is an extremely important event, recognizing the achievements of our students and recognizing the important milestone of entry to Primary School. All Reception students and parents only are invited to join us. Due to the limited seating available, please understand that we cannot invite extended family to attend.

The ceremony will begin promptly at 10am and will include musical performances and speeches from students and staff.  Class awards will be presented for the following:

Creativity

Friendship

Sportsmanship

Endeavour

Independence

All Receptions students will graduate during the ceremony.

Please note that this is a formal occasion and that all students should wear their full school uniform.

The ceremony should conclude at around approximately 10:45am and will be followed by an EYFS picnic giving the community an opportunity to say ‘farewell’ before the summer break.

Due to the capacity of the hall, Nursery parents will not be able to attend the graduation, however they are invited to join the picnic celebrations afterwards in an opportunity for the whole of the phase to get together.

School will finish at 12 noon on Thursday 3rd July and buses will run as normal at this time. Please ensure that if you are not using the bus service, you make appropriate arrangements for your child to go home at 12.

I look forward to seeing you on July 3rd and of course before then at our end of year parent and teacher consultation evenings.

Best regards,

Paul Seedhouse

Headteacher
