Dear Parents,



Thank you for your wonderful support this first half term. I hope that you enjoy the break and we look forward to seeing the children when school opens again on Monday October 28th. Please see our weekly update information below.



ISI Inspection



I am pleased to say that we have received exceptional oral feedback from the ISI team this week. We now have to be patient while the report is fine-tuned before we can share it with the community. I am confident that you will be extremely proud when the report is released towards the end of November.

Our pupils have been superb ambassadors for the school this week and we would like to thank you for supporting them at home so that they have been able to show themselves at their very best.

Story week

EYFS and Primary pupils will be looking forward to our first week back when we greet our guest author Mr. David Webb to ISM for a week of workshops and activities. The theme for this year will be magic and will support learning in both reading and writing.



Of course on Friday November 1st all EYFS and Primary pupils and staff will have the opportunity to dress as a character from a favourite story.

I am sure that it will be a fantastic start to the second half of the term. Thank you to Ms. Ruffin and Mr. Broom for organizing this special week.



** Please note that International Week will take place in Term Two for all pupils this year, having been moved to accommodate our inspection visit! **



“A” levels confirmed at ISM



I am extremely proud to confirm that ISM will begin our “A” level programme in 2014-15. This will ensure that our pupils will have the opportunity to complete their pre university education with us. It is our ambition that ISM pupils will go on to study in some of the best universities in the world and our courses will be designed to support this aspiration.



We will be able to develop our current site in order to support Year 12 and 13 for the next two years ensuring that there will be no unexpected location issues for our pupils.



We will provide further information regarding this exciting development in the coming months.



More Football Heroes



I was lucky enough to attend the weekend 7s tournament graciously hosted by AAS last Sunday.



It was a glorious Autumn day and the spectators were treated to some fantastic football as well as some much needed sunshine.



I was particularly proud to watch over 70 pupils from ISM participating with the guidance of staff and Sports Leaders from our Secondary School. It was also wonderful to see so many parents supporting our teams. Levels of skill, effort and enjoyment were all high resulting in two trophies being won by our pupils.



A big “thank you” and well done to all members of our community that supported this very successful event.



Senior production “Honk” - a request to Secondary parents



The Creative Arts department is trying to gather together some items of costume for the secondary production of &quot;Honk&quot;. We were wondering if you have any of the following items at home which your child could bring in to school. The items will not be returned so they need to be old, something you are willing to be cut up!


White shirts
Plain yellow or green t-shirts
Grey suit/school trousers
Yellow or floral dress knee length with sleeves (this is for a 16 year old to wear)
Blue swimming shorts
Blue swimsuits
Plain green leggings/trousers
Plain yellow trousers
Orange football socks
Old grey men&apos;s suit
Tails jacket
Top hat

The Moscow Youth Basketball League

We are delighted to announce a fabulous sporting opportunity which is on the horizon.  As the Moscow Youth Soccer League has now ended, all eyes now turn to the Moscow Youth Basketball League.  It would be fantastic if we can have a large number of ISM students taking part.

Please click here to download the information on how to register.


All the best, and for those of you going abroad, safe travels.
