Dear Upper Campus Parents,



We are pleased to announce that the Upper Campus Library is considering launching a new initiative whereby parents and children can spend time together in our library after school. If the response is favourable and logistically feasible, the scheme may become a regular fixture in our schoolâ€™s calendar.





For more information please  click here.

If you have any queries please do not hesitate to get in touch with us.

Have a nice weekend.

Kind regards,


The International School of Moscow
