Dear Parents,

As we draw towards the end of a fascinating and challenging week, please enjoy the following information.

International Week

I thoroughly enjoyed the opening ceremony of our Secondary International Week on Monday. This Winter Olympics themed event has been a terrific opportunity to celebrate our host status and encourage the pupils to engage actively in their learning both inside and outside the classrooms. Well done to Mr. Story and Ms. Hamilton for their leadership in organizing the activities. Next week is the turn of EYFS and Primary and I am sure that they will enjoy a similarly motivating experience.

Honk!

Final rehearsals are now in session and our annual Senior Production of Honk is just around the corner. Performances are on Monday and Tuesday evening next week. Please do make a date to join us and support the pupils and staff that have worked so hard over the last few weeks. We hope to see you there!

Recruitment Trips

The key to any great school is the teaching staff working there. With this in mind, I am pleased to again report that retention of staff is excellent for the coming academic year. However due to some inevitable transition and the continued expansion of the school, we will again be recruiting in the UK over the coming weeks.

Please be aware that Ms. Doubleday and I will be away recruiting in the UK for Lower Campus and EYFS Rosinka in the week beginning February 17th. Paul Keach and I will be recruiting in the UK for the Upper Campus in the week beginning March 3rd. During these weeks, should you need any support or advice on important issues we will be contactable by email though do understand that responses may be slower than usual.

Confirmation of Appointments

I would like to confirm that three familiar faces will be returning to Moscow to lead the opening of our new EYFS site at Rosinka in April.

Daniel Frater will be working in Reception and coordinating the EYFS team.


Holly Roberts will be teaching in Nursery, ably supported by Sasha Frater who will be one of three Assistant Teachers.

Elizabeth Salter will also return to work at ISM in August 2014 in a year group to be confirmed.

It is of course very reassuring to know that so many staff recognise the quality of our school and are eager to return to the fold!

MISAS Middle School Championship Basketball Tournament

Sunday 2nd February saw the second annual MISAS middle school Basketball tournament hosted by the International School of Moscow in partnership with The Krylatskoe Sports Palace.  The tournament played host to 10 teams in a girls and boys competition.  The event was a huge success and we can again be proud of our performances. The ISM Lion Boys came through an extremely competitive tournament to become champions while the ISM Lion Girls just missed out, finishing in the runners up position. A big ‘thank you’ to everyone that took part and made the event such a huge success.

ICT E- Safety information event- Tuesday 11th March

We will offer a second opportunity for all families to learn more about the challenges and solutions to helping children to use technology safely at home and in school. Please do make a note in your diary of this date. Refreshments will be served in the Upper Campus canteen from 8:20, and the event will begin at 8:45.

If you have any doubts about the importance of this topic, please also read the supporting article in the imminent newsletter that I am sure will convince you that this session is worthy of your attendance.

Uniform shop

The uniform shop will be closed for stock count during the half term break. If you need any uniform items please do so next week. The shop will be open as usual as from 3rd March.


ISM Expansion

Finally, I am very excited to confirm that ISM will be offering additional provision for EYFS and Primary school pupils at the Rosinka residential site from August 2014. We will take over the current BIS buildings on that site. This is in addition to the EYFS site that we will open in April. Initially preference for places at ISM Rosinka will be offered to pupils currently studying there. However in Term Three, should places remain available we will clarify the procedures for parents who may wish to consider a place on that site.

The provision on our current sites will remain the same for 2014-15 though we are actively seeking opportunities to develop a purpose built secondary site located on this side of the city.

There will be more information to follow on developments in the coming months and we will keep you as fully informed as possible.


Have a wonderful weekend.
