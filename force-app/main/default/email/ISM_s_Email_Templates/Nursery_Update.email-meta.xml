Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.LastName},

Unfortunately Mrs Jill Mian recently confirmed to us that her medical condition has not improved and that she is still unable to commit to a return to Moscow or work for the for-seeable future. This means that with regret and in consultation with her, that we have made the decision to close her contract. However, I am pleased to announce that Mrs Samarin will continue in her teaching role for the remainder of the year. This will avoid  further disruption to the class and ensure that the children will get the best possible experience in preparation for Reception.

I am sure that you will join me in wishing Mrs Mian the very best in her recovery.

Best regards,

Paul Seedhouse
The International School of Moscow
