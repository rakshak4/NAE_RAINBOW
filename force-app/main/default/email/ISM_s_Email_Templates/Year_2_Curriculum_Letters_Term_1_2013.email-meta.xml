Dear Parents,


Welcome to The International School of Moscow! For returning parents, we hope that you had a fantastic summer and are looking forward to an exciting year at ISM.


As always there will be lots going on this term. Firstly, you are welcome to come and ‘Meet The Teacher’ on Tuesday 10th September starting at 5:30, where you will be given lots of information that will help to build the all important communication between home and school.


We believe very strongly that to get the best out of your child we need to all work together. We can do this on a regular basis by using the blue home/school communication books. Please take the time everyday to check this and make comments if you need to.


For break time your child can bring a snack to school. Please help us by packing healthy snacks such as fruit for your children, as this will help them concentrate and learn more through the day. We are a ‘Nut Free’ school so please do check that your child’s snack does not contain nuts. In Year 2 we value the importance of protecting the environment and strongly advise parents to send their child to school with a water bottle every day.


Assemblies for everyone will be on Mondays and Fridays and the children will be required to wear their FULL uniform including blazers. Please ensure all items of clothing (or anything that comes into school) is clearly labelled with your child’s name. This helps us track clothing and teaches the children to be responsible for their own belongings. When your child’s class performs, you will be invited to come and watch the class’ assembly. 2A’s class assembly will be on Friday 31st January, 2B’s class assembly will be on Friday 7th February and 2C’s class assembly will be on Friday 14th February 2014.

Year 2 Production will be on the morning of Wednesday 25th June and the evening of Thursday 26th June 2014.


This term we also have many more exciting events happening for the children at school. Swimming will commence after the October half term break (Dates and times to be confirmed). The swimming Gala will be on Thursday 12th December. After School Activities will begin on Tuesday 17th September.  The children will also take part in the annual Book Week (w/b 28th October), where they will get to dress up as their favourite book character.

Please check the school website and Parent handbook for further dates. School Newsletters are also a great way to see what is going on at school.


We would like to thank you in advance, for your time and effort in supporting the children in all areas of their learning.



Yours Sincerely,


The Year 2 Team
