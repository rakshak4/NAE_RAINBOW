Family Fun day - Final update



I am extremely happy to confirm that the weather forecast for the weekend has improved dramatically and therefore we are able to hold our Family Fun Day this Saturday from 11am – 3pm on Lower Campus as planned.



It is worth mentioning that the field may still be quite damp and so if planning to bring a picnic, do take this into consideration. There will be very limited seating available and so cushions on top of picnic blankets might be the order of the day! We look forward to seeing you on Saturday.



Please do not forget to email the list of your family members who will attend the event and do not have a security badge to Ekaterina at info@internationalschool.ru, Please make sure you do this since our security staff will not let anyone in the school without a visitors pass.



In the extremely unlikely event of bad weather on Saturday, we would cancel the event. We will update this news on the website and will send an email to all families on Saturday morning ONLY in the event of a cancellation, so please make sure you check you emails and website.


School Developments



As all families will be aware we have ambitions to develop the school facilities beyond our present provision.



The planned improvements for our present upper campus are on track and in August this year we will open a new Gymnasium, an outdoor all weather sports area and three additional classrooms.



Looking further ahead we are exploring several options to develop additional sites though nothing has been confirmed yet. Of course we will inform you, ISM families, immediately of any further developments. At the same time, should any members of our community have additional suggestions or possible opportunities we are always open to suggestion!



COBIS Games



We currently have a squad of young sports men and women competing in this international event, hosted this year in the Netherlands. They will return to school on Monday and we look forward to sharing with you news from this prestigious competition.


Have a great weekend everyone and we hope to see you on Saturday.
