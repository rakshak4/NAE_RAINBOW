Dear Parents,

As a reminder we are sending you the schedule for the photographer for the rest of the days so there will be no confusion. Unfortunately the whole lower school photo has been postponed to Monday June 10th as there were a lot of children who forgot their full school uniform today.

If your child has a PE/sports day on the day of the photographs, please make sure that children are wearing their summer uniform (including blazers for Y1-Y10) on the following dates:

Thursday June 6th – Whole Upper School photo, Y4-10 class photos, Y1-Y10 class councils photos, Whole School House captains photo.

Friday June 7th – Sibling photos

Monday June 10th – Whole Lower School photo

Kind regards,

Sonya Matveeva

Academic Secretary

The International School of Moscow
