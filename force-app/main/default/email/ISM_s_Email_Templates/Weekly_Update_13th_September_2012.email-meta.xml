Dear Parents,

Like every week, please find below the latest ISM news.



Coffee Mornings



It has been a pleasure to meet with parents both new and well established at the coffee mornings on Lower Campus so far this week. It has been a great opportunity to establish contacts within the community and also discuss issues and ideas with the senior academic team. Thank you to all parents that have attended and supported these sessions. We look forward to meeting with Year 3 parents in the morning and with Upper Campus parents next week.


Please see the schedule below:


- Monday, 17th September 8:30 - 9:30 – Y4

- Tuesday, 18th September 8:30 – 9:30 – Y5

- Wednesday, 19th September 8:30 – 9:30 – Y6

- Thursday, 20th September 8:30 – 9:30 – Y7+Y8

- Friday, 21st September 8:30 – 9:30 – Y9+Y10


Playground Improvements Lower Campus



We have received lots of positive feedback on the new surfaces and seating areas installed this summer on the Lower Campus. Our students have thoroughly enjoyed the sunshine and outside play this week.


We will continue to add small play equipment for the students to enjoy over the coming weeks.


Winter or Summer Uniform?



Normally at this time of year we would still be enjoying sunny days and warm(ish) temperatures. However the weather has been quite cold at times and it is possible that this season the changeable weather will continue. With this in mind, please follow these guidelines:


· On warm days please wear summer uniform as normal at this time of year.

· On cold days do allow students to wear the appropriate winter uniform- we would prefer that all of our students feel comfortable at school.

· Ensure that on cooler days the students do bring coats and hats to school as we will encourage them to go out and get fresh air at every opportunity for break and lunch times.



New website



It was pointed out at the Lower Campus Meet The Teacher Evening earlier this week (quite accurately) that some of the information on staff members for example was now out of date.


We are presently on the point of launching our new website on which all of the information will be updated. Please accept our apologies on this matter and rest assured that the key dates and news items on our present website have been kept up to date. We will of course confirm to you when we “go live” very soon.
