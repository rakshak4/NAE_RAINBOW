Dear Parent,


As you may already be aware, from Year 3 your child will begin learning a new modern language in addition to the Russian language lessons already taught at ISM.


Children in Year 3 will now be taught two lessons per week of Russian and one lesson per week of either French or Spanish.


Any child who is a native or fluent speaker of French will automatically be enrolled into Spanish lessons and native or fluent speakers of Spanish will be allocated French as their new modern language.


Children who currently speak neither language, or have a very basic understanding, will be able to join either a French or Spanish group.


I would, therefore, be most grateful if you could inform me via the email address given at the bottom of this letter about which language you would like your child to learn. There will be one teaching group for Spanish and two for French.


The first Spanish and French lesson will commence on Tuesday 27th August so it is very important that we have as accurate as possible a breakdown of groups for each language by the end of Monday 26th August.


The language you choose for your child will be the language they continue to learn throughout their time at ISM. Furthermore, once your child has been allocated that language of choice there will be no opportunity for a switch over to the other language.


I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your support and wish your child well in their schooling for the next academic year.


Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions.


Yours sincerely


Ian Storey

Head of Modern Languages
