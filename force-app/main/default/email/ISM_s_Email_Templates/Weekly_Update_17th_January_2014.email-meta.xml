Dear Parents,

Apologies for the delay in the weekly update, we experienced some technical issues last week.

We would first of all like to wish you a Happy New Year. We hope that 2014 proves to be positive, productive, happy and most importantly healthy for your family.

Term Two has started smoothly and we have enjoyed welcoming several new students to ISM. I am sure that we will all work hard to ensure that new families are welcomed into our community.

The update this week is short but sweet! (I am aware that a lot of information has been sent out to parents due to the new term).
