Dear ISM Rosinka parents,


We hope you are all enjoying the sunshine and having a relaxing summer. All of us at ISM Rosinka are very much looking forward to seeing you at school soon!

We are writing to confirm that preparations for the school’s opening on Monday 1st September are proceeding according to plan. Enhancements to the facilities completed/currently in progress include the addition of a rubber sports surface to the playground, the installation of new climbing frames and other play equipment to the outdoor areas at both sites, and the new kitchen and dining room facilities.

We’re enormously excited about the progress that has been made and it’s a great relief for all concerned that we are now able to confirm a timely opening!

Staff arrivals begin this week so the main focus of our attention, in addition to completing the refurbishment, now turns to welcoming new colleagues to Moscow and providing academic staff induction.
