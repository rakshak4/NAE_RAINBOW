Dear Parents,

We have just a few announcements relating in part to events happening in the city over the next couple of weekends.

The Annual Ice Dip in Support of the Homeless in Moscow

A few staff members at ISM are doing the annual &apos;Ice Dip&apos; to raise money for the homeless.

We were hoping you might donate to this charity (using the link below) for which they will be painfully immersing their bodies into icy waters and then stepping out into temperatures of -15 to -23 this weekend.

Having watched this myself each winter I can honestly say it is difficult. It has been described as feeling like a stabbing sensation on your hands and feet when the cold air hits your wet body.

WHY then do they do it?

Its simple really ........ for the people who have no homes and live outdoors in Russian winters with NO MEANS OF GETTING WARM! Hope you can help a little......

Think of them on this Saturday at 11am!

Golf Event for Junior Players

I recently visited a great facility called City Golf in the centre of Moscow. I am hoping to develop links with them to enable our student body to have future access. In the meantime however I wanted to share some information on a junior event happening very soon that may be of interest to our young, keen golfers and golfing families.

Reducing Waste

In the last academic year, we managed to reduce the number of plastic cups being used in school with members of staff and students being very responsible for using their own water bottles wherever possible. However, we are falling into bad habits and the number of plastic cups that I have recently seen in waste bins is appalling.

With this in mind, we have decided that we will be removing plastic cups from the school in term 3. The only exceptions will be in communal/ visitor areas. Please support us by ensuring that your children get into the habit of coming to school each day with their own water bottles and we will ensure that water is available at all times to the students. Thank you!

Paul Seedhouse out of School

Please note that I will be out of school for the next week from Sunday 2nd February. I will be on inspection and therefore have extremely limited ability to respond to email communication. Should you need support on an urgent issue from the school, please contact a member of the Senior Leadership team:


Paul Keach for Upper Campus

Clair Doubleday for Lower Campus

Anastasia Ramazanova for Administration


We hope that you have a wonderful weekend.


Paul Seedhouse
