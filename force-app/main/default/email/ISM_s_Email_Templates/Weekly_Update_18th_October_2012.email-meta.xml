Dear Parents,

Looking for an engaging unique educational experience that will challenge and excite your child/ren? Please click here for a follow up of the information we sent out last week regarding TechnoKidz, the new After School Activity.



Please remember, although I&apos;m sure this is probably one of the first things you wrote down in your diaries, that next week is half term and there will be no school.




We would like to wish you a fantastic break and look forward to seeing you back on the Monday 29th October.


Happy Holidays!
