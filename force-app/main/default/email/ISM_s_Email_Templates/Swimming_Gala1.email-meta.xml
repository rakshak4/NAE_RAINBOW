Dear Parents,

If you wish to attend the Upper Primary Swimming Gala on the 4th April, please tell the swimming pool security that you are from ISM (Mezhdunarodnaya Shkola). That should be enough for them to let you pass.

In case you decide to book a pass yourself, please call 8 (495) 234-7451 in advance and give the administration your car number.

Thank you.

Kind Regards
Ekaterina Foster
