Swimming Gala Year 1- 3



Just a reminder that the annual swimming gala for Years One, Two and Three will take place on Thursday 6th December from 9:30 until 12:45.


All Y1-3 students must arrive at school as normal and will travel to the gala with their class. All parents from those year groups are invited to attend and should go directly to the pool. A more detailed letter will go out regarding arrangements and the venue (only 5 minutes by car from school) to families on Monday.

We look forward to seeing you there!


Library Thursdays



Our school library on Upper and Lower Campus remains open every Thursday from 3:25- 4:25 offering the opportunity for parents to visit the library with their children.



This initiative has now been running for several weeks but unfortunately to this point with limited support. Please do use this opportunity to share and select books together if you can.



Poppy Appeal



The total raised in Moscow for the British Legion this year was £2000 exceeding all previous years by some margin. We are proud to have given over £300 from the school in support of that total.

We have today received special thanks from the Embassy for our contribution raised by the students, staff and families at ISM. Well done everyone!


Confirmed Academic Calendar for 2013/14



We are pleased to confirm the academic calendar for 2013-14 below.

As you will see the structure for the first two terms is identical to previous years.



Term Three has been the subject of much deliberation. However, we have concluded that a two-week break to incorporate Easter will be extremely beneficial for the majority of the community, particularly at the end of a long winter.



However, in order to accommodate that, we cannot observe a half term break in May. This decision was informed due to the fact that IGCSE examinations are being completed during this time, on which a break would have a significant negative impact.



We will continue to review this structure in practice ensuring that it is indeed the best arrangement. You can now go and make those exciting travel plans!
