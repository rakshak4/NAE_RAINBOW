Dear Parents,

Poppies will be on sale tomorrow till the end of the week.

Please be aware that we have a limited supply of poppies.

A simple donation will mean that your child can wear their poppy this week and on Monday 11th November to remember those who lost their lives in wars and conflicts.

Why a poppy?

When?

The eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month marks the signing of the Armistice, on 11th November 1918, to signal the end of World War One.

At ISM we will have two minutes silence around 11am on Monday the 11th of November.

For more information about Remembrance Day go to:

Hope to see pupils &amp; adults of ISM wearing their poppies this week, there will be opportunities to discuss their significance at school, however it would be wonderful if you had a chance to share the above websites with your children.

Best Regards,

Clair Doubleday (Head Of Lower Campus)

The International School of Moscow
