ICT Information session

On Tuesday 17th December we will be holding an information session for all parents of students in the Secondary School about the ways in which new technologies are used to support learning at ISM.

Come along to find out about:


How students and teachers can use mobile devices to support and enhance learning;
Our ambitious plans for the use of new technologies in the future;
Student Digital Leaders;
How to best support your child to manage their digital lives safely.

There will also be an opportunity for parents to engage in an open Question and Answer session with Chris Mayoh, ICT Development Coordinator, to discuss the content of the session.
Refreshments will be served from 8.30am and the session will begin promptly at 9.00am. We hope to see you there for this important session.
Spring Term Invoices
Spring term invoices are due on December 15th, we very much appreciate the timely payments.
Safety at pick-up time
Our security team has asked me to remind all parents, drivers and nannies to ensure that all students on Lower Campus are supervised and dropped off at the gate in the morning. It is NOT safe to allow children to walk from the car to the gate independently at this age. Thank you for your support on this crucial health and safety issue.
Seminar Cancelled
Please note that tomorrow’s seminar - Life for the Spouse abroad – has been cancelled. We will try and reschedule next term.
Have a wonderful wintry weekend.
