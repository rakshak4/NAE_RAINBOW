Parent Update: Thursday September 26th


Dear Parents,


It may come as no surprise that this has been the wettest September since 1885 and we still have a few days to go! Nevertheless, we are doing our very best to keep pupils active and get a breath of fresh wherever possible. Please assist us in this by ensuring that they arrive at school with suitable clothing for the current weather.


Winter Uniform

With the above comments in mind and a forecast for lower temperatures in the next few days, please do exercise your judgment when choosing the appropriate uniform each day. We absolutely support wearing winter uniform on cooler days. Of course if we are fortunate to experience a late burst of summer and warmer temperatures return, summer uniform may also be worn leading into the half term.


Residential trips

If the temperatures are shocking for us that have remained in Moscow, imagine how it feels returning from Oman, Tanzania or the South of France! It has been great to see the Upper Campus back to full strength this week and pupils have been sharing stories of their amazing experiences from the residential programme. I hope that we will be able to share more stories via the next edition of the newsletter.


Parent and Teacher Consultations- Nursery and Reception classes

For our youngest pupils we have a very early opportunity for parents and teachers to meet and discuss how children are settling into class. These meetings will take place over the next two Thursdays between 4 and 6pm after school.

All parents within the EYFS stage will receive a letter this week, offering an opportunity to make an appointment to meet with their teachers. Please do respond promptly so that we can organize those appointments as efficiently as possible.


Parents of Primary and Secondary pupils will have an opportunity to meet with teachers later in the term of course.


Parental and Pupil Surveys

Thank you so much to all families that completed the online surveys for ISI. Your feedback will be used to great effect by the team as they scrutinize our work at ISM.


Pre- Inspection Visit Mr. Lewis

Mr. Lewis flew back to London last night having enjoyed a full day on each site, gaining a picture of life at ISM. Our pupils and staff have been tremendous ambassadors for the school. I lost count of how many pupils wished him a very good morning and he was certainly very popular at lunchtime in the dining hall of Lower Campus.

Mr. Lewis will return in two weeks with his full team to complete the inspection when we look forward to greeting them again.


Note From the Administration Team


Please note that the administration team will leave at 4 pm on Friday due to team-building activities. If you have any inquiries or need to purchase uniforms we would appreciate if you could time your visit to be able to finish before 4 pm.


A wonderful weekend to all families.
