Dear Parents,

I have recently returned from the annual British Schools’ Group Board meeting where all of our Headmasters meet and discuss future improvements and developments in each school.

This year we reflected at length upon the very valuable feedback given by you the parents via the online survey completed in May. We were very pleased to receive very high satisfaction rates in many areas of the school including academic progress being made by students, their enjoyment of school and the clear improvements made by the administration department in terms of level of service and efficiency.

Of course there are also several areas raised for attention. We have also listened very carefully to areas of the school that you the parents feel could be improved and would like to share our actions on the main points that were raised below.

Facilities at ISM

It was identified that due to the success and consequent rapid growth of the school, our facilities need improvement in some areas. We are in agreement on this point and continue to explore all options to enhance our facilities at ISM.

While our numbers have increased to just over 500 students this year, this number is equally divided amongst the two sites. This actually means that there are less students now on the lower campus than when I arrived at the school almost 3 years ago.

We will continue to ensure that numbers are managed carefully on both sites and future developments so that the quality of education is maintained.

Lower Campus

The lower campus is a lovely site but unfortunately restrictions on land use prevent us from adding any additional climbing frames, play equipment or additional buildings for the lower primary students. However we actively address this issue on an annual basis and will at the earliest opportunity improve this if permission by local authorities is granted. Despite these restrictions we have continued to invest in the site in the following ways:



- We have resurfaced all of the playground areas adding designs to support games at break and lunchtimes.



- We have created additional seating areas for the students to relax during break times.



- We have entirely remodeled the library and ICT area to maximise this space and ensure that ICT lessons in particular are much better catered for.



- We have appointed an Outdoor Learning coordinator for Foundation Stage who will be developing ideas to enhance the learning of our youngest students outside of the classroom as part of the curriculum. This will include the purchase of additional resources.



We will also begin to support our Lower Primary students to have access to new PE facilities being developed on Upper Campus during the winter months in future academic years.


Upper Campus



The upper campus as it stands is now reaching capacity and therefore we are pleased to announce that we are able to expand the present site to include the following improvements:



- A second larger gym, with theatre capacity for productions is being developed.



- Three additional classrooms will be created for the provision of secondary school students.



- A large all weather sports area/ outdoor space that will be used for PE curriculum and lunch/break times.



It is anticipated that these additions will be in place before the end of this academic year and we will of course share more details as developments are completed.


Further Developments



Further plans are also in the pipeline that would significantly add to our present provision particularly for Secondary School - and we will of course keep you fully informed as any further developments are confirmed. Our intention is to provide a high quality education for all students at ‘A’ level supporting entry to the best universities worldwide.


Language teaching at ISM



It was raised that the standards of progress and achievement within our Modern Foreign Language Department could be improved. In response to this we have taken the following actions:



- We have appointed a highly experienced and qualified MFL coordinator, Ian Storey who is working very closely with the department. Already clear improvements have been made in the teaching and learning in both Russian and French.



- For 2013/14 we will expand the department further with an additional member of staff joining the Russian department.



- We have already appointed an additional Russian teacher, Marina Korolkova, to enable groupings in four ability levels in appropriate year groups. We are currently reviewing the definition and structure of the different ability groups to better meet the needs of all students.



- We will introduce Spanish for non-native speakers to our MFL curriculum for 2013-14. The year groups will be confirmed later in the year.


The After School Activities Programme at ISM


While recognising that improvements had been made in the previous year, it was also identified as an area that both students and parents would like us to continue to develop. With this in mind we have agreed the following actions:



- We have appointed two ASA coordinators (Mr Hoult and Mr Carr) who ensure that an excellent range of activities are offered across the whole school each term.



- We have ensured that as many active ASAs as possible are offered in Term One and Three in line with the better weather months and facilities available.



- We are seeking opportunities for some ASAs to be offered every term so that our older students in particular are able to commit to an interest over a longer period of time.



- We are using expertise of parents, students and independent coaches to further increase choice of ASAs. (Please do volunteer!)



- We are providing more opportunities for female sports participation in ASAs.


Traffic Issues at drop off and pick up times



Access to the school remains a challenge for us all. Obviously, we remain restricted by the road network leading to the school but are committed to doing everything that we can to manage the situation.



- We will continue to review and enforce our procedures to maximise efficiency and safety at these times.



- Continue to negotiate with local authorities and landlords to improve access and construction of the road. We are very pleased that we were finally given permission to add the speed ramps earlier this year.


School Lunches



Despite having worked hard over the last 12 months to improve lunches this is still an area that we want to improve further. We will continue to take the following actions in order to develop a varied and healthy menu that students will enjoy:



- The Student Council will be involved in making suggestions and selecting additional dishes to the menu through regular tasting sessions.



- We have invited a small group of parents from the Class Representatives to support and advise on menu improvements.



- We will continue to work very proactively with our catering company to improve service that they offer.



Books in schools



One or two comments raised the issue of textbooks in school. While we have purchased full sets of core texts for IGCSE courses, lower down the school we do not encourage our teachers and students to just work from one textbook. Instead we use a variety of resources to support learning.



However we will continue to enhance the library and will be proving reading lists (a suggestion taken from the survey!) for year groups in preparation for the next academic year.


Bullying



This was only mentioned in one response form and we are very proud of the way our students conduct themselves and interact with each other in general. However, we would like to emphasise that we have a zero tolerance for negative or bullying behaviour and would ask that should parents have any concerns that they inform their class tutor immediately so that we can follow up. We also continue to teach and remind students about the dangers of bullying behaviour through assemblies, tutor times and PSHE lessons.


In Summary


Thanks again for your input and suggestions. They have certainly helped us to target areas that we can improve and develop at ISM. Your views are essential if we are to achieve our long-term objective of offering a World Class Education for our students.



We will offer the opportunity for you to complete an extended survey response again later this academic year and would ask again that you support us by offering your opinions.



In the meantime if you have suggestions, issues or ideas please do communicate them to our staff. I am hoping that we will introduce a suggestions box on both sites in the near future. Until then, do continue to communicate at class or subject level with teachers. If you have whole school, phase or site suggestions contact Mrs. Doubleday  (LC), Mr. Keach (UC) or myself. Your views and ideas are important to us and will always be considered!



Best regards,


Paul Seedhouse
