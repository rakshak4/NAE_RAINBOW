Dear Parents,



Please see an information update below.



Enjoy a wonderful weekend and happy Valentine’s Day!




IGCSE Options Evening



We have now entered the second half of the year and we are beginning preparations for our present Year 9 students to consider their choices for IGCSE options for the next academic year.



This is an exciting time for those students as they begin to identify the curriculum areas that really enthuse and interest them to pursue in more depth. It is also that first opportunity to study for formal qualifications that are recognized internationally.



With this in mind, we would like all Year 9 students and parents to put the evening of Tuesday 19th March in their diary for what should prove an informative event that will support and inform the choices to be made.



More details will follow immediately after the half term break. We look for ward to seeing you at the evening.



Additional Homework during absence



We have received several requests asking for the above during short periods of illness. In most instances detailed input from the teacher is required in order for the task to be completed correctly and it is better for this to be done once the student is well and has returned to school. Teachers will support gaps in learning and opportunities to catch up at that time.  For these reasons the school policy is not to provide work for students that are recovering from illness. They can of course enjoy some reading, particularly around the subjects being learned that week or term (Refer to curriculum letters or blurbs) Much better that they rest, recover quickly and return to school ready to learn. Thanks for your understanding on this point.


Tottenham Hotspur Football Camp Confirmed



We are pleased to confirm that following the fantastic response to the visit of the Tottenham coaching team last year, we will again host their International coaches. The camp will take place from Monday June 3rd – Thursday June 6th.



More details will follow regarding the content of the sessions, costs and timings. While we know that this will be a very popular event, please do not request a place at this early stage. We will confirm the places available and procedures for securing a place in the summer term.



Embassies of the World Dinner and Ball 2013



Moscow&apos;s International community is continuing its annual traditions with an evening gala on March 23, 2013. It will be the 17th year for the International Women&apos;s Club to host the event.



Oh la la! &quot;An evening in Paris...&quot;



It will be a special night for everyone to spend the evening socialising at one of the hosting embassies with dinner before the ball. Dancing will begin at 9 pm and continue until 2 am at the InterContinental Moscow Tverskaya Hotel.



The Embassies of the World Dinner and Ball is one of the IWC&apos;s most important fundraising events for its charities projects in Russia. We are thankful to everyone who contributes each year and we look forward to working with you again this year!


All parents and staff of ISM are more than welcome to join and show your dancing qualities!



Further details regarding tickets and participating embassies can be found at the IWC website: www.iwcmoscow.ru
