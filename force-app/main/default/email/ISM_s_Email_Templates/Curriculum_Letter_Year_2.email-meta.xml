Dear Parents,


Hopefully you all had a wonderful break and are looking forward to all that Term Three has on offer!


Last term was short but busy and now we are in our last term of the academic year.



We had some awesome events in Term Two that everyone enjoyed such as: World Maths Day, Art Week, Russian celebration and ISM has Talent.


We have lots of learning to do in our last term as well as enjoying the various events we have going on in Term 3.


We are sure that Term Three will be as successful as the previous two, rounding the year off nicely.

Reminders:



ISM is a ‘Nut Free’ school, please ensure that none of the snacks the children bring into school have nuts in them (this includes birthday cakes) and of course that they are healthy (no chocolate, sweets or crisps please). Thank-you!


In Year 2 we value the importance of protecting the environment and strongly advise parents to send their child to school with a water bottle every day.


Also, please continue to wait outside for your child to come to you at the end of the day as the locker rooms get overcrowded when parents and drivers come in to help children get ready (Please remind your drivers of this).


Uniform: Due to the weekly class uniform certificate I am glad to say that in general the children’s uniform has improved this year. Please continue to support us with this and refer back to the blue parent/student handbook to see exactly what your child should wear Eg. black leather shoes except on PE days when trainers are to be worn.


ICT: Please remind your children to use Purplemash.com at home and to complete the weekly ‘mymaths’ challenges that are sent home once a week. Also, don’t forget to check out the ‘App of the Week’ that is added to the weekly blurb.



As always, many thanks to you for all your support and I hope that your children will enjoy their last term in Year 2!



Yours Sincerely,


The Year 2 Team


Mrs. Arora (Teacher 2A) Mr. Grange (TA)

Miss. Salter (Teacher 2B)  Mrs. Mason (TA)

Miss Gaskin (Teacher 2C) Mr. Chapman (TA)
