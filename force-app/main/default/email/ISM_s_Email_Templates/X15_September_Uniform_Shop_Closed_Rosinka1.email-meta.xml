Dear Parents,

We would like to inform you that the uniform shop will be closed for 2 days, Monday and Tuesday, the 15th and 16th of September. We hope that all of you successfully purchased uniforms over the last week after we implemented the staggered sales.

We would also like to remind you that if you have not picked up your school contract, please kindly do so as we require the original copy. Copies can be made for your records as well. Please pick up your contract at the uniform shop from Wednesday, 17th September.

Thank you.

Kind Regards,

Rosinka Team
The International School of Moscow
