Dear Parents,

We would like to inform you that school reports will be available on the parent portal one week later than originally planned, on Friday 21st November, instead of the 14th. Please accept our apologies for this delay.

Please note that the parent and teacher conferences will still be held as planned, on the 25th and 26th of November, from 4-7pm. Therefore, you will have the opportunity to read the reports prior to the conferences.

Thank you very much.

Kind Regards,

Rosinka Team
The International School of Moscow
World Class Education
