Dear Parents,

We are looking forward to seeing you all at the ISM Family Fun Day held on the Lower Campus field on Saturday, 24th May from 11am to 3pm.

Please bring your biggest heart-felt smiles along with your picnic blankets and baskets with snacks and beverages (this can include wine and beer, but no liquor please). However tasty your cosy picnic lunch will be, please leave some room for the ice-cream donated by our sponsors! Please also check the weather forecast, as the use of sun hats, parasols and sunscreen might be needed. If, by any chance, the forecast aims to ruin our fun, we will notify you early on the Saturday morning and the event will be rescheduled for 8th June from 11am to 3pm.

Students are getting ready with their class stalls activities. The Sports Team is putting together a fun program for the day. Some of our talented students, as well as the teachers band, are tuning their instruments for musical surprises. And for the delight of children both big and small, a bouncy castle has kindly been donated by one of our parents.

The highlight of the event is of course our traditional Charity Raffle and Tombola, which will be full of great and exciting prizes. This year all the money raised from the tickets sales will be divided between two Russian Charities, as well as supporting the ISM Students Charity Committee initiatives in Tanzania and Cambodia. For more information on these charity organisations, please click on the links below.

Centre For Curative Pedagogics (CCP) who provide education and social support to children with disabilities - http://www.ccp.org.ru/en/

Our Sunny World (НАШ СОЛНЕЧНЫЙ МИР) Rehabilitation Centre for Autistic Children -  http://www.solnechnymir.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=367&amp;Itemid=7

The Meserani Project (Tanzania) which develops education provision for various schools in East Africa. Next year ISM students will visit the project and supply educational resources - http://meseraniproject.co.uk/

The Trailblazer Foundation (Cambodia) practises a sustainable, community-focused style of development, which is a low cost and long-term solution to alleviating poverty and increasing the quality of life in a sustainable manner. In the future, the students of ISM hope to visit the project and build a fence for one of their schools - http://www.thetrailblazerfoundation.org/

If you would like to participate in this great cause by donating prizes please contact Debbie Reynolds at debreynolds@me.com.

Let our Fun Day become a meaningful day for many people!

We are looking forward to seeing you.

Family Fun Day Team
