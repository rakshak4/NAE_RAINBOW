Bulletin – Week Beginning Monday 17th February 2014


Dear Parents,


On Wednesday 12th February, we held our first Careers Fair for students in Years 9-13. The evening was a success with over 40 careers represented and a pleasing number of student and parent visitors. I would like to thank all of the representatives who attended the Careers Fair to share their experiences and advice with our students. I would also like to thank Mrs. Ellis who put a huge amount of effort into planning this event.


We have a busy few weeks coming up with more events, parent evenings and school trips. Please take time to read through the details below.


NO ASAs - School finishing 3pm Monday 17th- Friday 21st February

There will be no after school clubs next week and students will therefore be departing on buses at 3pm.The ASAs will resume the following week as normal. This is due to losing two nights to the Parent teacher consultations.


Tuesday 18th February, PTC (parent-teacher consultation) for Years 9,12 &amp; 13

On Tuesday there will be Parent Teacher Conference (PTC) for Years 9, 12 and 13 between 4-7pm.


For Year 9 students and parents, there will an IGCSE options presentation at 4.00-4.30pm repeated again at 6.00-6.30pm in the Theatre. I would urge students and parents to attend one of these presentations.


Thursday 20th February, PTC for Years 10 &amp; 11

On Thursday there will be a PTC for Years 10&amp;11 between 4-7pm.


For Year 11 students and parents, there will an A Level options presentation at 4.00-4.30pm repeated again at 6.00-6.30pm in the Theatre. I would urge students and parents to attend one of these presentations.


Please note that the PTC for Year 7 and 8 students will take place on Monday, 28th April.


Valentines Disco Cancelled (All Years)

Unfortunately, the Valentines Disco planned for this Friday 14th February has been cancelled due to lack of ticket sales. This is unfortunate, as the students involved in the organisation had put a lot of work into planning this event. We have decided to run both a Junior Prom and Senior Prom next term and hope that more students will to attend these.


Wednesday 19th February, Spanish trip Years 8 &amp; 9

After studying the topic of ‘Diet and Dining Out’ for several weeks; all Year 8 &amp; 9 students of Spanish will be visiting Solo Tapas in Taojin on Wednesday this week to sample some Spanish delights over a tapas lunch.


Saturday 22nd &amp; Sunday 23rd February, Bugsy Malone Rehearsals

There will be weekend rehearsals for the Bugsy Malone school production this weekend. Students involved are aware of the details as well as those for the further weekend rehearsals in March. Mr Moore and his cast have already been working hard on preparations for the production and I am pleased to see so many committed individuals.


Parent Art Exhibition Reminder

As a celebration of creativity within our BSG community the Art department invite any parent who enjoys creating Art to submit one piece for a temporary school display. So if you a painter, sculptor, photographer or similar then please pass your artwork to the school reception along with your name, title of piece and contact details by Friday 21st February. The exhibition will run until Friday 14th March, at which point you are welcome to collect your piece from the school reception.


Best wishes,


Mr. Iain Ruck,

Head of Secondary
