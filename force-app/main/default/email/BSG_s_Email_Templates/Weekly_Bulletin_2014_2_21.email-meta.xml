Bulletin – Week Beginning Monday 24th February 2014


Dear Parents,



Advanced warning: Residential trip Meeting: Wednesday, March 5th 2014

There will be a meeting to discuss the residential trip programme for this academic year. A letter will be going out on Monday to give an overview of these trips and students. Years 9 – 12 will need to make their decisions by March 7th to allow for booking of flights and to give families time to apply for Visas if these are necessary.



PTC/ Options evening:

It was pleasing to see so many parents attending the PTC this week. Please note that option forms (Year 9 and Year 11) should be completed by Friday, 28th February 2014.

Advanced warning: The PTC for Year 7 and 8 students is on Monday, April 28th 2014 after their full reports.



Year 9 &amp; 11 reports

Students in Years 9 &amp; 11 have received their full written reports to take home to parents this weekend. These reports include the progress students are making in their subjects as well as comments from their Tutor regarding their general behavior and effort in school.



Weekend Bugsy Malone rehearsals

There will be weekend rehearsals for the Bugsy Malone school production this weekend. All students involved in the production (cast, sound, lighting, costume, props) have already met with Mr. Moore on Thursday to find out what is expected from them for the rehearsals. If any parent is interested in sponsoring the programme then please contact Mr. Moore. Ted.moore@bsg.org.cn



Normal school finishing time resumes

ASAs (week 4) will resume on Monday 24th February. Buses will depart as usual at 4pm during the week and 3pm on Friday.



Bronze International Award trip

The time has come for 21 year 10 pupils to undertake their assessed trek to enable them to pass the Adventurous Journey section of the Bronze International Award.  As with the practice trek the pupils completed back in November in the Liuxihe National Forest Park all participants will complete a 2day hike with one nights camping, which they fully prepare for by themselves in small groups.  This time the pupils will be trekking within the beautiful Sai Kung country park in Hong Kong, over the weekend of February 28th till March 2nd.  We wish all the pupils good luck in passing this section of the Award that they have been preparing for several months now.



World Book Day- Thursday 6th March

World Book Week is a chance to celebrate the joy of reading and this year we would like to encourage as many students as possible to get involved. Thursday 6th March will be a fancy dress day where students should come dressed as a book-related character.  We’d love to see Harry Potters, Hobbits and many other crazy characters wandering around the school that day!  A character parade and ‘best-dressed’ competition is being arranged during ASA time and students will be able to pick up House Points for many different competitions taking place in the week.



Parent Art exhibition runs until Friday 14th March.

Parents participating in the Art exhibition should now have submitted their artwork to our school reception. The exhibition will run until Friday 14th March, at which point you are welcome to collect your piece from the school reception. We welcome everyone in our BSG community to come into school and enjoy the exhibition.





Best wishes,



Mr. Iain Ruck,

Head of Secondary
