Dear all,



The GETCH Festival will be taking place on Saturday 26th April 2014 at Golden Arch Residence, Er Sha Island, Guangzhou. The money raised from the event will be going towards their rehabilitation fund. This is a great opportunity to support one of the schools affiliated charity.


Raffle tickets for the event are available from lower and upper school reception as well as from the Charity Committee students in Secondary. Each ticket will cost 15 RMB and  the money raised will also be going towards the rehabilitation fund.


Thank you,



Amanda Boby
