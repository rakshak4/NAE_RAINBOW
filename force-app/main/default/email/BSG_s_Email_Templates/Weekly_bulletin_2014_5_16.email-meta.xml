Bulletin – Week Beginning Monday, 19th May 2014



Dear Parents,



PRC Basketball tournaments: Our basketball teams competed in the PRC Annual Basketball Tournament last weekend managing to bring back some well-deserved trophies (and memories) for BSG.



The U14 girls were ecstatic after winning their tournament and receiving the 1st place trophy, a first for the team. The U14 boys put up an equally valiant effort and managed to take 3rd place against some very steep competition in Shenzhen. The U12 girls won the 2nd place trophy and sportsmanship trophy for their efforts in the tournament and the U12 boys finished 4thafter an intense, nail-biting semi final. We are extremely proud of all of our students who took part in this tournament and I look forward to watching these teams develop next year.



Art trip May 16th -17th 2014:

A number of students from Year 9 and 10 are attending the Art trip in Hong Kong. We hope that they enjoy themselves looking at the Art Basel exhibition and that it serves as a useful educational experience.



Junior Prom - Years 7-9

Prom will be taking place at BSG on Friday, 6th June between 6.30pm-9.30pm with a strictly formal dress code. Students wishing to attend should order a ticket from their Form Tutor before Friday 23rd May. They cost 50RMB and include entrance, buffet and a bus to Citic Plaza.



Exam Week (Mon 26th May- Fri 30th May) - Years 7-10

Students have now received a timetable for next week’s examinations. The exams are scheduled throughout the week and when they are not sitting exams, students will be attending classes as normal.

Nigerian kidnapping:

The school believes that our students should be encouraged to engage in both our local community and also to develop an awareness of global issues. In a response to the recent kidnapping of schoolgirls in Nigeria, the Art department designed an activity that asked our students to reflect on this incident and also to link it with their experiences. The result has been an art display in reception area at the Nanhu site. Our message is a demonstration of our commitment to education for all as a fundamental human right and is linked to the global “#Bring back our girls campaign. I would like to thank Ms. Barrenechea for leading this initiative with Mr. Delmotte’s support and also to congratulate Sueda Zanlier and Resham Kundnani for helping to drive this with our student body.
