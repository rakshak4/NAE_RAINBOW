Dear Parents,


Thank you for being a part of the British School of Guangzhou family. We are grateful for your continuous support and involvement.


We are currently busy planning facility improvements and classroom resources for next academic year (2014/15). As we do each year at this time, we would like to ask you to help us by providing as much notice as possible of your intention to leave or remain at BSG next year.


We would also like to remind families who do plan to leave us that the return of any refundable student placement deposits held by the school or payment of ‘Early Notice Payback’, if this is applicable to your family, is conditional on the school receiving a minimum of three months written notice of withdrawal prior to the last day of attendance in school (note holiday periods such as the summer break do not count as time served as notice).





IMPORTANT REMINDER: if your intention is to leave at the end of this academic year, notification should be received by our Admissions team before Thursday, 27th March, 2014 to be eligible for any deposit refunds or &apos;early notice&apos; payments. If you require more information regarding deposit returns or early notice payments, please contact Irene@bsg.org.cn or admissions@bsg.org.cn  or refer to the contract you  signed with the school when your child first enrolled.



With this in mind, please return the slip below to us (a hard copy will be sent to you tomorrow afternoon with your child) or simply email your intentions to admissions@bsg.org.cn no later than Thursday, 27th March 2014. A &apos;Leaver’s Form&apos; will then be sent to families who do not require a place with us next year and the best possible planning can be put into place for those students returning to school 25th August 2014.


Kindly also note you need only inform the school once of your intentions for next year so please ignore any further communication on this subject once you have given us your intentions.





Thank you in advance for your co-operation,



The Admissions Team

The British School of Guangzhou






Please tick the appropriate box and return this slip to school before Thursday, 27th March 2014.
