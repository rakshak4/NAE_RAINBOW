Dear Lower School Parents,
I would like to inform you that due to Air Quality Index (AQI) levels exceeding 200 this morning the children did not go out to play during their morning break and P.E. lessons were relocated indoors. We will continue to check the AQI levels throughout the day and if they continue to be over 200 the children will stay indoors during playtimes.
Kind regards,
Miss Kathy
Head of Lower School
The British School of Guangzhou
