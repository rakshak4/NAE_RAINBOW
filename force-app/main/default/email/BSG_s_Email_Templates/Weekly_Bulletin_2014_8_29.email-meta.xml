Bulletin – Week Beginning:  Monday, 1st September 2014


Dear Parents,



Welcome to the new school year at the British School of Guangzhou. It was a pleasure to meet so many new families on our Meet the teacher day on Friday, 22nd August as well as seeing some familiar faces from our returning families. The school year has got off to a very positive start and this positivity has been in part due to the excellent examination results achieved by our students this year.



Excellent examination results:

Our first Group of Year 13 students performed extremely well in their examinations and will be attending prestigious university destinations as reward for their hard work over the preceding two years. Half of our Year 13’s gained entry into the Top 35 Globally ranked Universities. 50% of all examinations taken were A*- B compared to 26% in the UK and the school is particularly proud of the achievements of our first graduating class.



Last year’s Year 11 cohort also excelled at their IGCSE examinations and have achieved a tremendous set of examination results. 53% of all IGCSE examinations taken ended with the top grade, A*, compared to the UK average of 6.7%. Over 75% of all examinations were A*-A compared with 21% in the UK. All our Year 11 students achieved at least 5A*- C grades and our results place the School firmly in the top tier schools when compared to schools in the UK or other international schools. We are incredibly proud of our students for their fantastic performances.



Parent Support Groups (PSG):

We are very interested in improving our communication with parents in the secondary phase of the school. With this end in mind we are asking for volunteers to put their names forward to be part of the Parent s support groups for secondary. We will be having a meeting for all parents, and particularly those who are interested in becoming PSG members at 10:15am on Wednesday, 10th September 2014. Please email me at iain.ruck@bsg.org.cn to register an interest.



FOBISIA trials:

Trials will be taking place for Year 9/10 FOBISIA sports teams on Monday, 3-5pm: Students will need to make their own way back home after these take place.



Orchestra:

The Music Department We would like to encourage students from all year groups who play an orchestral instrument (Strings, Brass, Woodwind or Percussion), to get involved with the BSG Orchestra.  It will be held on a Tuesday from 3pm to 4pm.  Anyone who would like more information please see Mr. Haslett in the Music Department and sign up as soon as possible!



Chinese Mooncake Festival trip:

Ks3 students taking Chinese will be visiting the Garden Hotel on Wednesday, 3rd September to celebrate the approaching mid-autumn festival. Students will learn the history of the festival and be treated to a moon cake baking demonstration by the hotel’s desert chef. I am sure the students will have a fantastic morning before returning to school for afternoon lessons as normal.



Mid- Autumn Festival Non school Uniform day:

On Friday, the school will be having a non-school uniform day to mark the Autumn Festival. Students are asked to dress in traditional Chinese attire. Please note that there will be a 10RMB charge with the proceeds going to ActionAid: China. http://www.actionaid.org/china. We are very keen to continue supporting local charitable initiatives with an educational link as we believe this will resonate most closely with our students.



Charity event: BSG Team Overnight Trek

Eight members of staff (Chris Wright, Douglas Allan, Emily Hardwicke, Kevin McDaid, Hannah Corbett, Iain Ruck, Lou Ruck and Fanie Van der Merwe) are attempting to trek 30km or 43km overnight over the peaks of Hong Kong to raise money for Room to Read Hong Kong.  The Barclay’s Moontrekker event will undoubtedly be a challenging event and there is still a lot of training that needs to be done before the 10th October! http://www.barclaysmoontrekker.com/en/home.html



“Room to Read” are a fantastic charity who focus on literacy and gender equality in education. They work in collaboration with governments across Asia and Africa to develop literacy skills and support girls to complete secondary school with the life skills they need to succeed.  The team are aiming to raise as much money as possible with their efforts and would be grateful for any donations. If you can help, please visit: https://www.justgiving.com/BSGTEAM.



Room to Read Book Sale

After the success of last year’s second hand book sale, we want to make this one even bigger and better!  The sale will be held at lunchtime on Wednesday 24th September with all proceeds going to the charity ‘Room to Read’ who help to develop literacy skills and educational opportunities across Asia and Africa.



If you have any second hand books that you would like to donate to the sale, please ask students to drop them off in Room 27 with Emily Hardwicke (Head of English) or leave them at the reception desk.



Year 9 Art Trip: Students will be able to gather primary research from direct observation of the insects on display; this information will then be used back in school to inform the development of a mixed media sculpture. Cross-curricular links are made to the Genetics unit in Science, in addition to deepening student’s knowledge of insect anatomy and classification.



ASAs:

The ASA programme is due to start at the beginning of Week 4 (Monday, 15th September). Students have been asked to consider what ASAs they will be running and a booklet will be outnext week to support this. Sign up will start from Friday, 5th September.
