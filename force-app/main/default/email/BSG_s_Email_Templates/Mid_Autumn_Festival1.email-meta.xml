Dear Parents,



On International Day 2013 we will have a &apos;Secondhand Uniform Stall&apos;, with all proceeds going to charity. This is a project that our Secondary students are assisting with as part of their studies. The uniform stall will be set up throughout the day to give parents an opportunity to buy &apos;almost new&apos; and unwanted uniform items at a much reduced price.



If you have any old or unwanted uniform items that you are willing to donate to this stall, please send them in to school by Thursday, 7th November, and please don&apos;t forget to visit the stall during the festivities of International Day (9th November!).



We will continue collecting secondhand uniform throughout the year to enable us to hold similar charity sales at other school events.



Thank you in advance for your support with this initiative.



Best wishes,



Amanda Boby
