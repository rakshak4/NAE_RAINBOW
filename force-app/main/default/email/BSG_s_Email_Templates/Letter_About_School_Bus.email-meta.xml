Dear Parents,


We would like to apologise to parents and students on the school buses that unfortunately left school late this afternoon. This subsequently caused a wait for many of you as students arrived home later than expected. This is regrettable and we are currently working very hard rectifying the issues that arose with the result that you will see steady improvements from tomorrow and as we progress through the week.


We thank you for your patience at this busy time of the year and hope this did not spoil any child&apos;s first day back at school.


Yours sincerely,


Claire Guo

Bus Coordinator


The British School of Guangzhou
