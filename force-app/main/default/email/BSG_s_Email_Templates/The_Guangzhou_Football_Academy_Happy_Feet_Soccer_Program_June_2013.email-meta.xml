Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

I am pleased to announce that The Guangzhou Football Academy is now able to offer a programme for the youngest of our students - Please CLICK HERE for flyer. The Happy Feet Soccer Programme will trial their first classes during the month of June. The programme is aimed towards children between the ages of two and four years old and will take place at the Lower School campus (Lakefront) every Saturday during the month of June, from 10:00-11:00am. The football coaches come with a wealth of experience in teaching pre-soccer skills to young children.

If you would like to enrol your child on the programme please print the second page of the attached flyer, complete the registration details, scan and email to the address given enquiry@hkf-acadamy.com

Payment should be made in cash on the first day of the programme. If you have any questions regarding the soccer school please do not hesitate to contact the lead coach Oliver Burton-Towell at guangzhoufa@gmail.com

This is a great opportunity to enhance your child&apos;s gross motor skills whist having fun with their friends. Please note this programme is not exclusively for BSG students, therefore if you have any friends that would like to join in the fun please do forward this email to them.

I shall look forward to seeing many of our parents and students at the first class on Saturday June 1st.

Kind Regards,

Miss Kathy

Head of Lower School
