Bulletin – Week Beginning Monday 23rd June 2014



Final Week Arrangements



Dear Parents,



Secondary classrooms have been empty this week, as students have been enjoying residential trips in various locations around China and Europe. We have been kept up to date with the adventures through the use of online blogs and I would encourage you to spend a few moments to take a look through these.



Parents can access this by clicking on via our VLE: https://www.itslearning.com. Please then select The British School Foundation and enter the following username and password.



· Username: parent.residential



· Password: Residential



This should take you to the secondary residential 2014 page and the links to the blogs are here.



I have included the pick up details for each trip at the end of this bulletin.



There are a number of activities happening in our last week before we break for the summer. Students will be celebrating with their Houses at special House activities as well as taking part in exciting enrichment lessons that aim to explore, enhance and stimulate creativity. The week will end with our annual Speech Day at the Sofitel. Students who will be receiving an award should have received a letter inviting parents to attend this event and share in the special occasion. The winners have been carefully selected as someone whose efforts are to be held up as an example to their peers and we are extremely proud of these students. I am looking forward to ending the term with this special day.





House Day- Wednesday 25th June

This year we are having a House Day at the end of term to celebrate the amazing efforts put in to all House competitions throughout the year.



The day will begin with House meetings where students will celebrate their achievements and highlights from the year. This will be followed by a Big House Quiz.



Houses will then take part in activities, mainly offsite, for the remainder of the day. Parents should have received specific details of these activities in letters sent home last week.
