    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

As part of our on-going efforts to improve the quality of the education and service we provide, we are currently conducting a short, group wide survey of our parents.

The questionnaire is short and should take you only a few minutes to complete. Your feedback will be used to improve our schools and it will be treated in complete confidence.

To access the survey please visit http://app.fluidsurveys.com/s/british-schools-group/langeng/. Please note there is a section for open comments, feel free to write anything you consider important here.

We would like to thank you in advance for taking the time to complete the survey and look forward to receiving your feedback.

Kind regards,

The British School of Guangzhou
