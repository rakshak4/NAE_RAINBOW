Dear Year 10 and Year 11 Parents,

You are warmly invited with your child to attend an IGCSE information evening at Upper Campus on Thursday 15th September at 6.30pm to 8pm. This event will outline the IGCSE examination cycle next May/June 2012, the IGCSE mock examinations procedures this term, IGCSE expectations, student study/revision skills and information about the AS Level program that will be offered at BSG in 2012/13. After the presentations there will be an opportunity to discuss your childâ€™s progress with the subject teachers.

I look forward to seeing you all there at this very important event and cannot stress enough how important it is that you attend with your child. 

If you would like your child to stay at school before this event they will be provided with dinner in the canteen. Please confirm your attendance and if you wish your child to stay after school and not return home on the school bus.

Warmest Regards,
Dr. Dan Moore
Deputy Headmaster
BSG
