Bulletin – Week Beginning Monday 10th March 2014


Dear Parents,


Sixth Form Mock Exam Week

A-Level students will be completing their mock examinations this coming week. These exams are extremely important as they allow students and teachers to identify what potential A-Level grade a student may achieve as well as highlighting areas to focus revision efforts in preparation for the final summer examinations.

Year 12 and 13 students will be off timetable and are only required to attend school for the exams although they are welcome to study quietly in the common room. During this period, all students are expected to come to school in business dress and follow the signing in and out procedures located in the common room.



Bugsy Malone tickets go on sale

Tickets for the school production- Bugsy Malone will be going on general sale from Wednesday 12th March costing 50RmB each. Shows will be taking place at the end of this month on Wednesday 26th and Thursday 27th March between 7pm-9pm.



The cast and crew have been working hard to put together the show and we hope to see as many people as possible enjoying the performances. There will be a final weekend rehearsal on Saturday 22nd and Sunday 23rd for all the cast and crew.


Residential trips

Students in Year 9 – 12 will need to choose their preferred trips by Friday, March 14th. The residential booklet is attached and is on the VLE in the Secondary Residential 2014 section and it will be on the website shortly. I have left the trip blogs from 2013 on the VLE. These will be useful for Year 7 and 8 students to see what happened in more detail last year on the Hainan and Dali trips. Please CLICK HERE for the RES trips options.



IGCSE and A Level options:

These blocks are currently being drawn up and will be with students from Wednesday next week. Option choices will need to be completed by Friday, March 21st.


U13 FOBISIA Games

Students involved in the FOBISIA Games will be heading off at the end of next week for the games. Students will be away from school from Saturday, 15th March to Wednesday, 19th March. I wish all the students the very best of luck.


Parent art exhibition finishing this week

An exhibition of artwork created by our parents will be finishing this week. If you submitted any artwork for this please collect from reception after Friday.



iPad usage- change of rules

Due to ongoing misuse of iPads we have now decided to close the lunchtime iPad games room. From now on, there is a strict ‘no games’ policy in school between 8am-4pm and students should only be using their iPads for education purposes during this time. We hope that this will encourage our students to spend their break time socialising and interacting with one another more and less time on their devices.


Best wishes,


Mr. Iain Ruck,

Head of Secondary
