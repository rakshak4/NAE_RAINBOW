Year 11 Mock Exams

Many of our IGCSE students will be preparing for their upcoming January Mock exams over the break. These exams are extremely important as they allow students and teachers to identify what potential IGCSE grade a student may achieve as well as highlighting areas to focus revision efforts in preparation for the final summer examinations.


The mock exams will begin on Monday 13th January for around two weeks and all students are expected to come to school during this time as normal and will be using Mr Howe’s classroom for quiet study. We must have prior written and signed consent from parents in planners if they are happy for their child to leave school premises when they are not in an exam. For a few students there may be a day during the exam period when they have no exams in which case they are not expected in school on this particular day.

Arrangements for New Term

Students will be returning on Monday 6th January to a full school day. In the first week there will be no ASAs so students will be departing at 3pm. Students must remember to signup online for their new ASAs choices, which will commence in the second week of term.


Finally, I would like to wish a fond farewell to some families who will be leaving us this Christmas. I wish you the best of luck in your new adventures and hope you keep in contact.

Best wishes,


Mr. Iain Ruck,

Head of Secondary
