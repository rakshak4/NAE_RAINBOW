School Photographs: The School photographer is in school next week. It is therefore very important that all students bring their blazers and full winter uniform for the week. The whole school photograph will be on Monday, nd the and sibling photographs will be on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday depending on which phase the siblings are. On Thursday students will photographed together with their form groups.

Chinese New Year: On Friday 1st February the secondary school will be celebrating the Chinese New Year festival. There will be a dragon dance at 10:40am, a musical performance at 12:05 in the theatre and a Chinese lunch buffet. Eurest will be catering for the event, as normal, but students have been asked to bring in a dish to add to the buffet that will be being served on this day. The more dishes that we have the better the buffet will be! Students are also asked to dress in Chinese traditional dress.
