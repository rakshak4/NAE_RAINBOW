Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

A camera was lost by a family during Speech Day last Friday. The camera contained some important memories, not just of our Speech Day. The school would like to ask parents who attended Speech Day to contact the school if they found a camera or have any idea where it might be.

Please contact Jean Liu if you can help- jean@bsg.org.cn.

Thank you,

Administration Team
