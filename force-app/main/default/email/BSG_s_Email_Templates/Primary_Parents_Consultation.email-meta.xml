Dear Parent


The Primary department will be hosting their Parent Consultation Day on Monday 18th November. The event will take place between the hours of 9:00am – 6:00pm. As a result, students will not be in school on this day. However, we encourage parents to bring their child to the consultation meeting so they can be present when the teacher gives feedback. Meetings should last for approximately ten minutes.


Using the return slip below, please show which is the most convenient session for you to attend by adding 1st, 2nd and 3rd choice to the grid. You may also email or write a note to express preferred timings. The teacher will then provide you with a specific time to visit on the day. A note will be sent home confirming your meeting time.


Chinese, EAL, PE and music teachers will also be available to speak to you. Please understand that there may be additional waiting time to see a specialist member of staff.


The first school report of the year will be sent home on Friday 15th November. This document should be used as a discussion point for the consultation meeting.


I would like to add that my office door is very much open to anyone who would like to speak to me personally on the day.


Kind regards


David Laird
