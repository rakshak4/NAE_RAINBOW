Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We are pleased to announce that BSG parents have kindly been invited to attend a variety of Reading Workshops that will take place at Utahloy International School on Saturday 10th and Sunday 11th November.Please click here for more information.

Due to the importance of reading we plan to send many of our Lower School and Primary staff to the workshops taking place on the Sunday, as these offer valuable professional development opportunities to our staff.

Please note that the Saturday workshops are unfortunately on the same day as the annual BSG International Day.

If you would like to attend any of the reading workshops please contact Utahloy School directly (the email address is on the attached document) and payment should also be made directly to Utahloy International School.

We would like to take this opportunity to thank Elaine Whelen (Head of Utahloy International School) for extending this kind invitation to our staff and parents.

Regards,

Miss Kathy
Head of Lower School
The British School of Guangzhou
