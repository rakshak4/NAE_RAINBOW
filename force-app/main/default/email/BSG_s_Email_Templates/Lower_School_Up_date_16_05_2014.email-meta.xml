Dear Parents,
Despite the very wet, hot and humid weather we have been experiencing recently we have still managed to have a busy time on the Lower School campus!
Sports Day
Although it tried very hard, the weather was actually unable to spoil our recent Sports Days. The children, staff, and hopefully parents, all had a fun and exciting time during the sports events with students showcasing some impressive sporting skills and determination. There was an amazing sense of sportsmanship and enthusiasm and special congratulations should go to the Pre-Nursery and Nursery Yellow Team and the Reception and Year 1 Blue Team for being the overall winners. I would like to take this opportunity to thank staff and parents for supporting our Sports Events and for making them such an enjoyable time for everyone.
Parent Rep Meeting
On Thursday 8th May we held a Lower School Parent Representative meeting which gave parents an opportunity to discuss Lower School specific developments with me. It proved to be a very positive meeting and I would like to thank those parents that were able to attend for their support and contributions. Next year each phase in school will create their own Parent Support Group (PSG) to enable parents to have more of a ‘voice’ with regards to events and fund raising for their specific phase and will help make decisions on  how raised funds will be spent. If you would like to be part of the Lower School or Primary PSG please do come to the first PSG meeting which will take place in early September.
Swimming
Due to the poor weather Reception and Year 1 swimming lessons have been postponed for two weeks. Swimming is an important part of the curriculum and every child’s development, therefore, once swimming lessons begin it will be an expectation that all students participate. Please note that swimming will only take place if the temperature is above 25 degrees and air quality is at a healthy level. If you are able to help with changing the children during their swimming lessons please contact your child’s teacher.
Nursery Bake Sale
The Nursery Bake Sale was a huge success this week with an abundance of goodies being sent to school by the Nursery parents. The Bake Sale raised a total of 1,040RMB which will go towards our charity funds for ActionAid and GETCH (see more details about our chosen charities below). Some of the children were also treated to a spontaneous singing performance from the Nursery mums when they sang ‘Happy Birthday’ to Miss Sophie. A huge thank you to the Nursery parents for such delicious goodies and a special thank you to the parents who were able to come along to school and run the Bake Sale - a very enjoyable and tasty morning!
Lockdown Practice
On Wednesday 14th May we had our very first lockdown practice on the Lower School. An important aspect our health and safety policy is to ensure there is a planned, prepared, organised and practiced response to any risk, threat or hazard that might impact on the staff, students or the capacity of the building to operate normally. The lockdown procedure was discussed with all staff and students and I am pleased to say the practice went extremely well. The staff ensured correct procedures were followed and most importantly that the children stayed calm and were not distressed in any way. In fact, the children all thought it was a huge game of hide and seek where they all had to hide and I had to find them - the children obviously won and took great pleasure in telling me I couldn’t find them!
Mosquitoes
Unfortunately we are at the height of mosquito season and whilst we fumigate the school premises on a regular basis we still get lots of mosquitoes within the surrounding area. If your child is susceptible to mosquito bites please use some form of mosquito repellant (patches, bracelets, etc,) and send in mosquito repellant spray for playtimes.
House Competition
Over the next few weeks we will be asking the children to collect one and five jiao notes to bring into school. In the main reception area we have four tall tubes (one for each house colour) in which children will place their one and 5 jiaos. Towards the end of June we will count the jiaos that each house has collected and there will be a special splash day for everyone to celebrate the funds raised. The students in the house team that raises the most money will each get the unique opportunity of throwing wet sponges at me. So, if you would like to help give your child the chance to soak Miss Kathy then start saving those one and five jiaos. All money raised will be going to our chosen charities of ActionAid and GETCH.
Charities
Over the past few years BSG has supported many charities, but there are two particular charities that we have had the pleasure of giving a great deal of support to:
ActionAid
BSG has been supporting ActionAid for several years and will hopefully continue to do so in the future. The money that goes to ActionAid assists in supporting rural schools in China that have limited resources and aims to provide an improved learning environment. It also allows ActionAid to create projects that support the local community where these schools are based.
GETCH
During this academic year BSG’s Student Charity Committee have been working with GETCH (Guangzhou English Training Center for the Handicapped). This has involved an art project and also working on events such as International Day, the ‘GETCH 5K run, walk or roll’ and also the GETCH Festival. The Charity Committee are currently working with GETCH to create an ASA programme, that will allow GETCH to visit our school during ASA time and take part in activities that focus around music, sports and also art. Money raised by BSG students and parents will help the Charity Committee to continue their vital work in the community this year.
I hope you find the above information useful and that you are able to collect lots of jiaos for your child to bring to school. We are hoping very much that the sun starts shining for us as we prepare for the final few weeks of our school year. If you would like any further information about any of the above points please do not hesitate to contact your child’s class teacher.
Kind regards,
Miss Kathy
