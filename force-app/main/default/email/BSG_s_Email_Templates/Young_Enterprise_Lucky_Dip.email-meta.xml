Dear Parents,


Following on from the school’s successful ‘International Day’ in November, we are very pleased to announce the generous donation we have been able to give on behalf of the British School Community to the Philippines’ Typhoon Appeal.


We really could not have made this day the success it was without all the hard work from everyone – students, parents, teachers and friends. We sincerely hope that this money, USD $4395, will help the many people still suffering today in the Philippines.


We look forward to welcoming back everyone in the New Year and wish everyone a safe and happy holiday period.


With Thanks,


Events and Fundraising Committee (EFC)
