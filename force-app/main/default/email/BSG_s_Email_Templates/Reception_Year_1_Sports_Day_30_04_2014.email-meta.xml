Dear Lower School Parents,
Due to the continued rain we will be postponing the Reception and Year 1 Sports Day until Monday 5th May from 9:00-10:30am.
We are hoping very much that Monday will be dry as due to the number of children and parents we have in Reception and Year 1 we are unfortunately unable to hold this event inside.
Thank you very much for your understanding with this and please accept my apologies for any inconvenience caused.
Kind regards,
Miss Kathy
Head of Lower School
The British School of Guangzhou
