Dear Lower School Parents,








I am pleased to inform you that the air conditioning and electricity supply have now been fully reinstated on the Lower School campus. School and the school bus service will resume as normal tomorrow (Thursday 19th June).
I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your understanding on this matter and the supportive emails we have received. This was obviously an unforeseen incident and I would like to personally apologise for any inconvenience caused. Teachers have been in school today preparing extra work over the next two days to cover any lessons lost through todayâ€™s closure. Please be prepared for extremely tired children returning home on Friday!
Thank you again for your understanding and continued support.
Kind regards,
Miss Kathy
Head of Lower School
The British School of Guangzhou
