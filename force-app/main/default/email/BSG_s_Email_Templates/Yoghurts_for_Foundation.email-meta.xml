Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

I am pleased to inform you that from Term 2 the children in Pre-Nursery, Nursery and Reception will be provided with a yoghurt upon arrival at school. This light breakfast will be provided by the school at no extra cost to parents.

Upon receiving parental feedback regarding the change to our school hours I was made aware that some families find it difficult to ensure their child eats a substantial breakfast before leaving the house in the mornings. Therefore, the provision of a yoghurt upon arrival at school will ensure our youngest students have a nutritious snack in addition to their breakfast before their school activities begin.

The usual snacks for Pre-Nursery and Nursery students will continue to be served and Reception students should continue to bring in their healthy, nut free snacks for their morning and afternoon break times.

Kind regards,

Miss Kathy

Head of Lower School
The British School of Guangzhou
