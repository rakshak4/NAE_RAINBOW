It is expected that all Year 7 students and all Year 12 and 13 students will be in school. The Year 7’s will be given a short induction into life in the secondary school. The Year 12’s will make final decisions on their subject choices and will be introduced to the expectations of the Sixth form. The Year 13’s will confirm their A2 choices and assist guiding groups around the school.
