Dear All,
 
We are having a clothing and shoe drive at the Lower Campus School in aid of ‘Guangzhou Huiling Community Service for People with Mental Disabilities’. If you have any unwanted adult, children’s or baby clothes or shoes at home please send them to the lower school campus. Please note all clothes and shoes must be in good condition and to enable us to get them to the given charity before Christmas all donations must be received at school by the latest Wednesday 30th November.
 
Your support for this very good cause is much appreciated.

kind regards,
