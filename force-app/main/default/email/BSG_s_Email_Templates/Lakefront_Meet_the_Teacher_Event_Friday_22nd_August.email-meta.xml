Dear Pre-Nursery, Nursery and Reception Parents,


I hope you all had a wonderful summer and are excited about the start of a new school year.


On Friday 22nd August we will be holding our &apos;Early Years Orientation Morning&apos; for new families and our &apos;Meet the Teacher&apos; event in the afternoon. If you are planning on joining us for these events can you please note the following parking arrangements:



Please refrain from stopping your car on the road outside of school, even if it is to just drop someone off.
Please do not park on the road under any circumstances.
The car park above school may be used, however reserved parking spaces should not be used.
Once the car park above school is full the security guards will direct you to park in G Block car park.
Lakefront Management will clamp any car that is illegally parked.



Thank you very much for your support with the parking arrangements and I shall look forward to seeing many familiar faces returning to BSG and welcoming new families to the school.


Best wishes,


Miss Kathy


Head of Lakefront Early Years Campus
The British School of Guangzhou
