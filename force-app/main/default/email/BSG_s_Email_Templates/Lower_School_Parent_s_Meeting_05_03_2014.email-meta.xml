Dear Lower School Parents,
On Wednesday 12th March at 10:00am we will be holding a Parent Meeting in the Lower School Hall. If you are planning to join us for the meeting I would like to remind you that the main entrance to Lakefront may still be closed due to construction work, therefore parents need to enter the compound at the G Block entrance. Please also note that once the car park directly above the school is full, vehicles will need to be parked in the G Block car park.
Important - All vehicles must be parked in a designated parking space. Please do not park cars on the road or anywhere else that may cause a safety risk.
Kind regards,
Miss Kathy
Head of Lower School
The British School of Guangzhou
