Dear Parents,&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;



The second edition of term one is now available to view online. As we head towards Christmas, we&apos;re seeing a flurry of activity throughout the school.



There&apos;s animal antics in Lower School with a visit from Duoduo the sheepdog, a teddybear picnic and magical dragons. At the same time, Reception test their senses and House events are in full swing.



It&apos;s a busy time in Primary with metro races, Science Day and the Swimming Gala, and if that wasn&apos;t enough, we have a residential special covering all the trips from Year 3 to 6.



Secondary have been showing off their talents with a fantastic Music and Performing Arts Evening and a string of superb results in football. A word from our newly announced Head Boy and Girl leads us into the Sixth Form Outward Bound sailing trip and we introduce you to our pastoral team. There is also some important news from our student charity committee.



Please have diaries ready as we are also happy to announce all the dates for the Christmas choir performances!



Enjoy!
