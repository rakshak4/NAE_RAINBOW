Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

I would like to start by welcoming students and parents, new and old, to the beginning of a new Primary School year at BSG. We have some new faces around school and a lot of familiar ones too.



As the new Head of Primary, I’d like to invite you along to the ‘Meet the Teacher’, event taking place this Saturday at 4:30pm. Mr Thomas and I will be welcoming you in the theatre with a presentation on exciting school developments.



After this, you will be able to visit your child’s new teacher in their classroom. Teachers have prepared a presentation to talk about expectations and systems in their class.



Eurest will be providing a barbecue outside the reception area, providing a great opportunity to network with other parents, teachers and teaching assistants.



I’d also like to send out a plea to any parents interested in taking part in a staff vs parents football match. Please bring your kit with you! The staff are keen to show-off their skills on our brand new purpose built football pitch.



I look forward to seeing you on Saturday.


Yours faithfully


David Laird
Head of Primary
The British School of Guangzhou
