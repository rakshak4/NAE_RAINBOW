Secondary Induction Day – Meet the Teacher Event


Dear Parents,


Please be aware that the first day of the new academic year on Friday, 22nd August will be an &apos;Induction Day&apos; &amp; ‘Meet the Teacher’ event. There will be no formal lessons on this day; therefore school uniform will not be required.


New Families Only:

We would like to formally invite new BSG students and parents to join us from 10:00am. As well as a presentation from the Secondary school’s senior management team, there will also be an opportunity to meet your son/daughter’s new form tutor, as well as our subject specialists who will provide you with information specific to your child’s courses to assist in making that start to the school year as smooth as possible.


Existing KS4 &amp; 5 BSG Families:

Existing KS4 and 5 students (Years 10-13) and their parents are encouraged to join us from 12:00 midday, as the day will involve the communication of much new information that will be especially relevant for students in these year groups.


Timetable for the day:



10:00am-3:00pm Ongoing opportunities to informally meet tutors and subject teachers.

10:45am-11:30am &apos;An introduction to life in the Secondary School&apos; (New Students)

There will be light refreshments served for all Secondary parents between 11:00am and 2:00pm in both the canteen and reception area, where room information will also be displayed.


All students will come to school as normal, with a full bus service being provided from Monday, 25th August.


Please also note that the uniform shop, situated on the Nanhu Campus will be open from Monday 18th August.


We look forward to seeing you and hope you have a relaxing summer holiday.
