Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

The Chinese Department is pleased to invite you to join us for our Year of the Snake Chinese New Year celebrations. For this yearâ€™s event we have organised a LF Chinese performance (31.01.13-Thursday 9:am-LF campus), a NH primary performance (01.02.13-Friday 9am-NH campus) a Secondary mini concert and a secondary lunch buffet (01.02.13-Friday-12:40pm-NH library), and also a dragon dance show performed by teachers.. All parents are invited to join the children for our Chinese New Year celebrations.

Besides the performance and the dragon dance show, we will be setting up a stall on each site to sell the CNY cards designed by students from Y1 to Y9. Please note that the profits will be donated to the Action Aid Charity which our school is supporting this year.

If you are planning to come to BSG to enjoy these Chinese celebrations we would like to invite you to get into the spirit of the day by dressing up in a Chinese outfit. All of our staff and children will be likewise attired on these 2 days and it promises to be a splendid event.

Please click the link for the performance list.

Looking forward to seeing you all on those days!

Kind regards,

Alison Liu
Head of Chinese
