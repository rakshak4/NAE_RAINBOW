Bulletin – Week Beginning Monday 24th March 2014



Dear Parents,



No school for students – Monday 24th March

Please be reminded that there will be no school for students on Monday 24th March, as teachers will be undertaking in-service training. This day coincides with the PTC’s for Primary and Early Years phases.



U13 FOBISIA

Congratulations to the Under 13 team that competed in South Korea this week. We had a number of successes, most notably Rebekah Dahlgren who won 5 individual gold medals and 7 in total from the swimming and the Athletics. The Girls and Boys football teams finished 6th and 7th respectively and were very competitive throughout.

The basketball teams finished 5th and 7th. The students were excellent ambassadors for the school and a huge thanks to Mr. Furniss, Ms. Stephenson and Mr. Liu for taking the students on this adventure.



Bugsy Malone

Tickets are still available for the school production on Wednesday 26th and Thursday 27th March. Tickets costing 50RMB can be purchased from Jessica at the Nanhu front desk so please do come along for what promises to be a fantastic show. The staff and students have worked incredibly hard in preparation for this event and we hope that they will be rewarded with a full audience for both performances.



I would like to say thank you for the generous donation by the EFC who have contributed over 20,000RMB towards updating the lighting in the Theatre. Staff and students using this space from across both Primary and Secondary Schools will certainly benefit from the improved facilities.



Arrangements for the holidays

I would like to wish you all a pleasant Easter break and I look forward to seeing everyone when we return on Monday 7th April. School will be finishing early on Friday for the holidays and buses will be departing at 12 noon.



No ASAs

School will continue to finish at 3pm until the new ASA block begins on Monday 14th April. Students are once again encouraged try something new for their activities.





Best wishes,


Mr. Iain Ruck,

Head of Secondary
