Dear Parents,

This year we are looking to run two proms for our students. The first prom will be the senior prom that will take place in the evening of the 26th April at The W in Guangzhou. This will be an opportunity for our year 10’s to 13’s to dress up in the style of James Bond and have a serious amount of fun at this end of year formal event. Last year was the school’s first formal Prom and it was a great success. We hope this year’s will be even better. Tickets must be purchased by the Friday 11th of April. Please note that if there are not sufficient ticket sales by this date, the prom will be cancelled. Cost is currently 350 rmb per person and this covers hire of the venue, food and unlimited soft drinks.

On June 6th we will be hosting our first Junior Prom. Students have been meeting with Ms. Burgess and deciding on how we will run this event. It will be the first of its kind for Key Stage 3 students and we are confident it will be a great night for all those involved. Further details will be sent out to all students in Key Stage 3 by the end of April.

In order to raise money for both events, we are having a non-uniform day on Friday 28th of this week. Students will be asked to bring in 10 rmb to wear their own clothes and all monies will go towards the Junior and Senior Proms. We apologise about the short notice.

One of our goals is to make both events as low cost as possible. Our senior students have been speaking to several businesses regarding sponsorship of either event. If you know of anyone who would be willing to sponsor both or one of these events then please contact either Miss Welch or myself and we would be happy to send through more information.
