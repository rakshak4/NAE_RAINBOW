Maths Day Fundraising Event - 30th April 2014




Dear all,


On Wednesday 30th April Maths Day will be taking place in Primary.  To continue with the maths theme the Charity Committee have been given the opportunity to carry out a fundraising event that will promote maths. This is along with the other interactive activities that will be going on during the day.


Outside the Year 2 Tigers’ classroom (opposite the library - CL-N17) there will be an interactive coordinates chart. To make the picture students need to bring in either 1 or 5 RMBs only as there will be coordinates for each. There will be two pots with coordinates for each note. The student can pick a coordinate out of the relevant pot and pin this up on the board to make a BSG inspired picture.


All funds raised will go towards the school’s two affiliated charities: ActionAid and GETCH.


Please note this activity will only be running during Maths Day on Wednesday 30th April 2014.




Regards,


Amanda Boby
