Dear Parents,



At the British School we employ a higher number of TAs than most other international schools, as we firmly believe that this has a positive impact on student progress. For the last 6 years the children of your school have also benefited from having a large percentage of native English speaking teaching assistants. Recently it has become more and more difficult to get the correct working visas, particularly for our gap year TAs. In the past they needed a degree and a TEFL teaching certificate. However new visa regulations state that they must also have a minimum of 2 years work experience after graduating This effectively means we can no longer recruit graduates directly from UK universities.



To put this into perspective it is important to note that we currently employ 40 teaching assistants in the following categories:

12 &apos;Chinese TAs&apos;
11 native English speaking &apos;locally recruited TAs&apos;
17 native English speaking &apos;Gap Year TAs&apos;

Without the ability to obtain correct visas for our Gap Year TAs next year, the teaching assistant ratios will most likely change to be more demographically similar to the other top tier international schools within Guangzhou. It is important to note we have been advertising for native speaking TAs since November 2013 and to-date have successfully recruited 8 who will join us in August 2014.



We will continue to do what we have always done, i.e. look for the best qualified people for the job. We would also be happy to receive applications from any parents who have the necessary qualifications, simply visit the website for details. Please note, these visa regulations only affect graduates fresh from university and in no way affects our ability to continue to attract the best possible teaching staff to the school. In fact I am pleased to announce that by the end of this week we are likely to be fully recruited in all phases for the start of the 2014/15 academic year.



There is no doubt that we are very disappointed to end our gap year TA programme. My own two sons benefited from this excellent programme at the British School of Beijing and coincidentally Andrew Fitzmaurice (Nord Anglia CEO) has always seen the value of this programme as his son also worked as a gap year TA in Beijing. Unfortunately we have to operate within the current regulations and have now accepted that employing graduates directly from university is no longer feasible.



Please rest assured that we will do everything possible to ensure that we deal effectively with this change and are confident that with training and support our new TAs will meet our high expectations and ensure that the British School continues to be the most academically successful school in Guangzhou.



Regards,

Mr. Mark Thomas

Principal
