Dear Parents,



Welcome to the final newsletter of the first term!



Time has gone by so quickly as we approach the Christmas period. As we begin festivities, the school halls are decked out in decorations for advent and the choir concerts are in full flow.



Last week we were lucky enough to be visited by former England football manager, Sven Goran Eriksson. He took time out of his busy schedule to answer questions and watch our own BSG football team train. It was a truly wonderful occasion and will certainly go down as a highlight of the year for all staff and students. Inside we have a special report from Chris Lin, Year 13, plus photos of the day.



Another big event was our International Day, bringing together the local expat community in celebrating our cultures. We have coverage of the build-up as well as photos of the day itself.



After taking a glimpse into news from around the Nord Anglia Education family of schools, we enter Lower School with a look at how the children prepared for International Day. There&apos;s also food, glorious food and a lot of healthy eating!



In Primary, there&apos;s everything from Jurassic fun and poetry to green screen technology and democracy study. Plus, we have all the Halloween activities and parties from both campuses.



Secondary students have ben participating in lots of charity work over the last month, with fundraising at International Day and the ActionAid visit to Guangxi province. Our Sixth Form group completed a leadership course, we have updates on university applications and a special report on the official opening of the common room.



We hope you enjoy this edition and look forward to the new year. Merry Christmas from BSG!
