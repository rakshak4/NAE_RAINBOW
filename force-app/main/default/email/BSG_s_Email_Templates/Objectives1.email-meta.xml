Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

This term our teachers have been reviewing the objectives that guide our school development plans. The process of setting these objectives has involved students, parent volunteers and teachers so I would like to thank everyone who has been involved. To view the objectives yourself please follow the link from the school principles on our website.

Teachers are using these objectives to guide our latest 2013-15 development plans. If you would like further information on the development plans or objectives please feel free to contact the heads of school directly.

Regards,

Mark Thomas
Headmaster
The British School of Guangzhou
