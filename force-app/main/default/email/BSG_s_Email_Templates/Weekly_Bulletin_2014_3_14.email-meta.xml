Bulletin – Week Beginning Monday 17th March 2014



Dear Parents,



Residential trip sign up

The sign up is live (on the VLE) and all students should complete this process by Tuesday, 18th March at the latest. Please indicate to your child’s form tutor if you know at this stage that you will not be attending the trip as this will assist staff planning.



No ASAs next week

As we come to the end of this ASA block there will now be a break until after the Easter holidays. This means buses will depart for home at 3pm for these next two weeks. The new ASA block will begin on Monday 14th April and students are once again encouraged try something new for their activities.



U13 FOBISIA Games

This weekend twenty-four Year 7/8 students will be heading to the U13 FOBISIA Games hosted by Seoul Foreign British School, Seoul, South Korea.

The Games will be running from Saturday 15th to Wednesday 19th March and students will be participating in swimming, athletics, basketball and football.

They will be competing against seven other International Schools from across South-East Asia and have been working very hard in preparation for these events.

Good luck to all the students involved and we look forward to finding out how they get on next week.



Advanced warning - No school for students – Monday, March 24th 2014

Please note that there will be no school for students on Monday, 24th March. Teachers will be in undertaking In service training. This day coincides with the PTC’s that are being hosted by Primary and Early Years phases.



Bugsy Malone rehearsals

On Saturday 22nd and Sunday 23rd March all cast and crew will be needed for the final Bugsy Malone weekend rehearsals running from 9am-3pm on both days. Please can those students involved remember to bring a packed lunch. We have lots to do so we expect students to be on time and bring a positive attitude with them! It’s going to be busy…



Tickets for evening shows (Wednesday 26th and Thursday 27th March) are on sale from Jessica at the front desk at Nanhu or via the main school telephone number.



Important Message Concerning iPad usage



I am writing to provide a further update with regard to student usage of their IPads. On the whole we are pleased with the way that IPads have increased our students academic freedom. We have however had some concerns expressed both from staff and parents with regard to other issues such as excessive gaming. As a result of an internal review we have decided to place a complete ban on gaming during the school day. Please note that students will be allowed to play games on the school bus.

From Monday, March 10th 2014 we will be implementing the rule that If a student is found playing games on their iPad during the school day then we will delete all games from this device. We shall also add the parental lock using the restrictions setting and this will disable the device from being able to download apps.

We are committed to ensuring that our students have access to modern technology to both enhance their education and to ensure that they are competent with devices used widely in the workplace. This new expectation will mean that the iPad is used for its intended purpose of enhancing learning. If parents would like the school to apply the parental lock on iPads then we are happy to support parents by doing this and any requests should be communicated to the form tutor. Alternatively, if parents would prefer to do this themselves then I have included a link to a step-by-step guide that will demonstrate how you to set up restrictions.
