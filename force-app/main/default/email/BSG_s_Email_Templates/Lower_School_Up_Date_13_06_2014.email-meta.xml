Dear Lower School Parents,
After spending ten days away in the UK attending an Educational Conference it is wonderful to be back at school and enjoying the children once again.
We have had a very busy week and I would like to share the following information with you.
Year 1 Treasure Island Performance
For those of you lucky enough to be able to attend the Year 1 performance of Treasure Island on Wednesday, you were witness to an amazing showcase of acting, speaking and singing. From the colourful costumes, imaginative props, creative make-up and stunning performances from the students, the whole event gave the Year 1 students and teaching team something to be very proud of. This performance showed just how much the children have progressed this year - a truly touching and inspirational performance. A huge well done to everyone who contributed to the show.
Pre-Nursery Bake Sale
Tuesday saw the first Pre-Nursery Bake sale of the year, and what a fantastic display of goodies they produced! Bake Sales are a favourite of the students and the smell of cakes drifting across the school is always a favourite of the staff. The Pre-Nursery Bake Sale raised an amazing 1,125RMB which will go into the Lower School charity fund. I would like to pass on my thanks to the Pre-Nursery parents that were able to offer their time to support the Bake Sale.
Council of International Schools (CIS) Visit
We had the privilege of welcoming two visitors from the Council of International Schools (CIS) this week. CIS are and accreditation body who visit schools to help identify areas of development to ensure year on year improvements. I am pleased to inform you that both visitors were extremely complimentary about BSG, more specifically they described the Lower School as &quot;a very special place for children”. We will be working with CIS over the coming two years to develop areas of weakness in our school to take it from good to great. A full report of the visit will be with us soon, which will be shared with parents.
Splash Days
This week has seen the Pre-Nursery and Nursery classes enjoying their Splash Days - lots of fun in and out of the water was had by all. Next week the Reception and Year 1 students will end their swimming module with their own Splash Days. They will have a fun filled afternoon of large paddling pools, water slip-slides, water guns, buckets, etc. We will also be announcing which house team has raised the most money form the ‘jiao’ competition and the winning house team will get the unique chance to throw wet sponges at me! I am expecting a very wet week next week!

Kind regards,
Miss Kathy
