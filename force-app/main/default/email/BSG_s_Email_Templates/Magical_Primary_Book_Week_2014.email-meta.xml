Magical Primary Book Week 2014




Dear Parents,


Next week at BSG we will be celebrating our love of great books and authors. We have a wonderful week of exciting, magical activities planned for our students, with a great variety of reading, writing, drama and art sessions planned to reinforce BSG’s love of books.


This year we are delighted to be hosting David Bedford (www.childrensauthor.co.uk), a wonderful British author, who will be working with each class from Y2 to Y6. David has published over 60 books for children, which have been translated into 30 languages and are loved by students, teachers and parents in countries all around the world.


This year will also see the return of BSG’s annual spelling bee! Students will be going head-to-head in class heats and year group finals in a competition that tests and celebrates excellent spelling skills. Winners from each year group will be awarded prizes in assembly at the end of the week.


Students from each year group have been working extremely hard on their bookmark and poster competition entries for the past two weeks. Keep your eyes open for the winning designs that have been made into the official ‘BSG Magical Book Week 2014’ posters and bookmarks! Winning artists will be awarded prizes in assembly next week.


Many other exciting activities will also be taking place during the week such as: visiting author workshops, storybook door decorating, magical treasure hunts, curl-up-and-read pyjama morning complete with hot chocolate and marshmallows, magic-themed story reading and writing and, to finish our magical week, BSG’s first ever storybook costume fashion show!


Please support this year’s event by remembering to prepare your child for the following events:


Pyjama ‘Curl-up-and-Read’ Day


On Monday 17th March, the first day of Book Week, we are having curl-up-and-read pyjama parties for all of our Primary classes. We ask you to send your child to school in pyjamas, slippers and a dressing-gown…and don’t forget to pack them a pillow and sleeping bag to snuggle up with during magical movie time! Hot chocolate (with marshmallows and cookies) is being generously provided by the EFC for this special event.


Storybook Costume Day



Don&apos;t forget that Friday 21st March is our storybook costume day. We would love to see all children dressed up as a character from their favourite children’s book (magical theme optional). All of their teachers and teaching assistants will be in costume too! Prizes will be awarded in assembly for the best student costumes and, for the first time ever, we will be asking students and staff to strut down the catwalk and strike a pose as part of our storybook costume fashion show!


It is going to be a fantastic week for our students and we can&apos;t wait to start the celebrations! If you have any questions relating to BSG’s Magical Book Week 2014, please contact your child&apos;s teacher.


With appreciation,
