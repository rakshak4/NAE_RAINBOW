Dear Parents,

The Education Bureau of Guangdong has just informed us that due to the typhoon warning, all international schools in the region will join local schools and close tomorrow, 23rd September. This will include The British School of Guangzhou.

Unless you receive notification via email from the school within the next 24 hours, we will be open as usual on Tuesday, 24th September.

Our apologies for any inconvenience caused by this closure.

Regards,

Mr. Mark Thomas
Headmaster
The British School of Guangzhou
