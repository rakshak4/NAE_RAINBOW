Dear Lower School Parents,

I would like to take this opportunity to inform you of the events that will be taking place at the Lower School during the final few weeks of the term.

Wednesday 27th November: House Events. Please send your child to school in their house t-shirts for a day of fun in house teams!

Thursday 28th November: Non-uniform Day. In an effort to raise money for the Philippines Typhoon Appeal we are inviting students to come to school in non-uniform on this day and make a donation of 10RMB for the privilege. All funds raised will go directly to those affected by the recent typhoon. Please also send in any unwanted clothes or blankets, which we will be sending over to the Philippines.

2nd, 3rd &amp; 4th December: School Photos. Please send your child to school in full winter uniform for these three days. No P.E. uniforms please.

Families are invited to join us for a family Christmas brunch in which you can enjoy a delicious buffet, participate in lots of Christmas activities, enjoy our Primary Choir carols and meet Santa Claus. Ticket information will be given nearer the date.

Lower School Christmas Productions. Due to an increase in student numbers we have decided to limit our Christmas productions to Pre-Nursery, Nursery and Reception. Year 1 students will delight you with their own performance during Term 3. Please see below for the dates of our Christmas performances. Save the date!

· Reception performance of ‘The Meaning of Christmas’ will take place on Wednesday 11th December at 10:30-11:30am in the Lower School Hall.

· Pre-Nursery and Nursery Christmas Songs performance will take place on Thursday 12th December from 10:30-11:30am in the Lower School Hall.

· After both performances there will be light refreshments provided for parents. You are also free to take your child home after their performance.


Book Fair: 11th &amp; 12th December. Children and parents will be given an opportunity to purchase high quality books from the UK at the Lower School Book Stall, which will be situated in the main reception area during the Christmas performances. Those parents joining us for the Christmas productions will be able to visit the bookstore themselves. The children will be asked to bring in money (approx. 100-150RMB) to purchase a book themselves from the Book Stall. Further information to follow.

Friday 13th December: Santa comes to BSG. On this day Santa will visit each Lower School class and will bring a small gift for everyone!

You will also be able to purchase calendars via a purchase form, which will be sent home soon. The 2014 calendar features a photo of each Lower School class and is available for 75RMB per calendar or 2 for 100RMB. We only have 300 copies so please do not hesitate in buying one as soon as they become available.

Thursday 19th December: TA Pantomime. On this day all Lower School students will go to the Upper School theatre to watch our very talented TAs in this years pantomime ‘Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’ – very exciting!
