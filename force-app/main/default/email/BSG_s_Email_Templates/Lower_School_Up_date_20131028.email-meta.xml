Bulletin - Week Beginning Monday 11th November



Dear Parents,



International Day- Saturday 9th November:

We are looking forward to International Day. It promises to be a fun packed day full of musical performances and activities for all to enjoy. The day will run from 11am to 3pm and I look forward to seeing you all there.



I would like to thank the parent reps and EFC who have been extremely busy helping to plan and organize this event as well as staff and students who have all contributed to planning activities.



Language Perfect Online Competition- Key Stages 2, 3 and 4:

Key Stage 2, 3 and 4 students who take Chinese as an Additional Language, French or Spanish have all been entered into an online languages competition taking place next week (November 11th - November 18th).



During this time students can use their iPads and competition passwords to go online and complete the relevant vocabulary games. While we would like students to take part and gain as high a score as possible in this competition, it is important that they continue to concentrate on their other homework and we recommend that they visit the website only when all other compulsory homework has been completed.



Sports Day – Wednesday 13th November:

Secondary Sports Day will be held at the Foreign Languages University on Wednesday 13th November. This is a compulsory event and all students must attend.

Students should come to school as normal as lessons 1 and 2 will be delivered before breaking for Sports Day.

Buses will be departing for the venue after morning break and returning to school in time for students to participate in their ASAs as normal.

Students may come to school already in their PE kit and they must wear their house shirts. Packed lunches will be provided and the Young Enterprise students will also be selling snacks and drinks throughout the day.



Parents are of course welcome and encouraged to come along and support their children. The address is:

广州市白云大道北2号广东外语外贸大学



In English: Guangdong University of Foreign studies, No 2 Baiyun Dadao, Baiyun District, Guangzhou.





This is a map of the venue and where the athletics track is situated on campus: Please click here.




University Notices- Sixth Form:

On Thursday 14th November Hong Kong University (HKU) will be at school giving a talk to the Year 12’s.

Also some advance notice for those Year 12 parents whose sons/daughters are considering applying for university in America – on 21st November a representative from the American Consulate here in Guangzhou will be advising students on SATS, Visas, the Common Application and university in America in general.



Both talks will be from 3-4pm in the Sixth form Common Room. Parents are welcome to attend both.



Leadership Weekend:

Next weekend our School Council students and their newly appointed Head Boy and Head Girl will be heading off for a leadership weekend in Guangdong.  This exciting trip will give the new team a chance to bond as well as developing leadership skills that I am sure will be useful to them as they take on the role of organisers and ambassadors for their peers this year.



Ipad help / cyber bullying letter:

Please find attached a letter with regard to ipad use and concerns that parents shared with me during a meeting earlier this year. Hopefully, this will go part way to resolve concerns that parents have. Please click here for the letter.



Advanced reminder:

Monday, 18th November is the Parent Teacher conference for Year 8 and Year 10 students.



Best wishes,

Mr. Iain Ruck,

Head of Secondary,
