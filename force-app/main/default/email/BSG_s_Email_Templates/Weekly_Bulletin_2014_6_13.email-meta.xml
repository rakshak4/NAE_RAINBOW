Bulletin – Week Beginning Monday 16th June 2014



Dear Parents,



Students will be heading off for their residential trips next week with those going to Germany leaving us this Friday. I have included a summary of the travel arrangements for each trip at the end of this bulletin for your perusal. I will also be here at school during that week should you need to get in contact with me.



Residential Trip Travel Information

Please remember the following to assist the staff that are running the trip:


1) To use the same travel document that parents gave to the school as the booking will have been made with reference to this.


2) Please be on time when both meeting and picking students up. The time it takes to get a group of 40 students through is considerably longer than you may allow for when travelling as a family. It will take the majority of the 2 hours set aside to collect and check names after each section of the check-in process.


3) Please only contact staff in a genuine emergency.


4) Each trip will be running it’s own blog. Parents can access this by clicking on via our VLE: https://www.itslearning.com. Please then specify The British School Foundation and enter the following username and password.

Other Bulletin items:



Last week arrangements:

Please ensure that you have contacted your child’s form tutor if they will be absent at any time, Monday – Friday of the last week so that we can keep our records up to date. A letter has been sent out with regard to Speech day on Friday, 27th June.



Council of International Schools (CIS) Visit

The school received two accreditors last week from the Council of International Schools (CIS). I am pleased to inform you that both visitors were extremely complimentary about BSG and picked out the quality of the well-planned and structured lessons as well as the positive relations between students and students and staff as their highlights. We will be working with CIS over the coming two years as part of a self-improvement process. The full report will be shared with parents as soon as it is available.



Music Festival:

The Music festival went very well today. I am particularly pleased for the Year 9 students that have worked very hard on arranging the event and to those that performed. We have been treated to some excellent piano recitals and compositions a talent show, 2 Year 7 performances and the students also created fund raising stalls with the money going to our selected charity.



Swimming Competition:

A number of our swimmers went to compete against Utaloy and we were delighted that a number of our students picked up medals through their excellent performances.



Junior Prom:

The Junior Prom that was held last week was a great success. The students dressed up for the event and this had a transformative effect on their appearance. Many thanks to Ms. Burgess for organising this and to the teachers and Mrs. Neel for assisted in setting up and supervising the event. Students will be able to use a USB stick to collect pictures of the event after they return from the residential trip.



Year 10 IGCSE Art Exhibition

Our students have been busy this last term in Art exploring a great variety of fields such as fashion, printing and paper cutting. We would like to invite you to come and see their preparatory work and final pieces on display on the first floor outside of the Art room.



Year 8 Kinetic Drawings

Last week, some Year 8 students took part in a unique performance. They drew patterns onto long pieces of paper using chalk following interesting yoga-based movements composed by Miss Asbury. The artwork and an accompanying video showing the performances are displayed in our canteen area. If you are interested in the work you should find out more about Heather Hansen, the artist who was the inspiration for this project.



House Day

This year we are having a House Day at the end of term to celebrate the amazing efforts put in to all House competitions throughout the year.



The day will begin with House meetings where students will celebrate their achievements and highlights from the year. This will be followed by a Big House Quiz.



Houses will then take part in activities, mainly offsite, for the remainder of the day. Parents should have received specific details of these activities in letters sent home last week.
