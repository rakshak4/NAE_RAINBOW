Bulletin –

Week Beginning Monday 10th February 2014


Dear Parents,


I hope you all have an enjoyable Chinese New Year break. I have provided some important notes below our return in February.


Careers Fair (Years 9-13)

A reminder to all parents and students from Year 9-13 that the inaugural Careers Fair will be held at BSG on February 12th from 5-8pm.  This is an invaluable opportunity for students to find out more about career options and receive advice from professionals on subject choices for GCSE and A level.  We have over 40 careers represented on the night and I recommend that parents and students come along and get involved.


Year 11 Mock Exam Results

Year 11 students have now completed their mock examinations and will be receiving their results after the holidays. Students will receive these in an envelope during Period 1 on Tuesday 11th February. The aim of this is to give students a more accurate experience of the opening of their final IGCSE exam results and sharing their achievements with their peers.


Valentines Disco (All Years)

Before Christmas we held a Key Stage 3 disco and the students thoroughly enjoyed the event. As a result we will be holding more this coming term and plan to begin with a Valentines Dance on Friday, 14th February (4-7pm KS3, 7-10pm KS4/5). Students will receive details about this in in due course.


Parent Art Exhibition

As a celebration of creativity within our BSG community the Art department invite any parent who enjoys creating Art to submit one piece for a temporary school display. So if you a painter, sculptor, photographer or similar then please pass your artwork to the school reception along with your name, title of piece and contact details by Friday 21st February. The exhibition will run until Friday 14th March, at which point you are welcome to collect your piece from the school reception.


Advance Notice- PTC (Years 9,12 &amp; 13)

On Tuesday 18th there will be Parent Teacher Conference (PTC) for Years 9, 12 and 13 between 4-7pm. During the evening there will be a presentation held for Year 9 parents regarding IGCSE options.


Advance Notice- PTC (Years 10 &amp; 11)

On Thursday 20th February there will be a PTC for Years 10&amp;11 between 4-7pm. During the evening there will be a formal presentation for Year 11 parents regarding A Level options.


Please note that Year 7 and 8 will have a PTC at the start of term 3.


Best wishes,


Mr. Iain Ruck,

Head of Secondary


iPad Usage Update- Mr Ellis

On Wednesday 22nd January I checked approximately half of the iPads in Key Stage 3. The main purpose of the check was to look at memory usage and games and I was pleased to discover that most students had only limited and age suitable games on their devices.

One of the most popular games it seems is N.O.V.A 3, which is rated as a 9+ and so is suitable for our students. However, as always with any games parents should see the nature of the game and ensure they are happy with their child accessing it.

One aspect of concern though was the memory usage. A significant number of students had managed to use over 75% of their memory, mainly with photos. One student had in fact used 98% of the memory available on the iPad leaving very little storage for school related activities. Students have been told to manage their memory and back up their pictures regularly so as to not overload the device’s memory.

A few also had cracks in the screens. The iPad screen is extremely delicate and so breaks easily. If it does break we strongly recommend that you take the device to an authorised Apple reseller and ask them to replace the screen.

If you have any further concerns regarding the iPad then please let contact me via email at Robert.ellis@bsg.org.cn
