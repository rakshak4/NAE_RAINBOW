Bulletin – Week Beginning Monday, 3rd March 2014



Dear Parents,



Bronze International Award trip this weekend

Pupils involved in the Bronze International Award will be trekking within the beautiful Sai Kung country park in Hong Kong this weekend. I wish all the students good luck in passing this section of the Award and thank Ms. Welch, Mr. Joyce and Mr. Howe for their support on this expedition.



Residential trip meeting- Wednesday 5th March

All parents are invited to an important information evening this Wednesday, March 5th 2014 at 6pm regarding the end of year residential trips. Please CLICK HERE for the residential intro letter.



This year students in Years 9, 10, 11 &amp; 12 will be selecting a trip from a range of options where as Years 7 &amp; 8 will still be attending specific year group trips. The trips will take place on the penultimate week of summer term between the period of 15th and the 22nd of June with the exception of the Germany trip that will run for 13 days leaving on the 13th June. Please see the separate letter with regard to this meeting.



Volleyball Fixtures:

We wish all of our teams the best of luck in this Saturday’s tournaments.



‘World Book Week’ fun

World Book Week is a chance to celebrate the joy of reading and this year we have a number of fun activities lined up for students to get involved in. Students can submit a photograph capturing them reading in an interesting or unique location for the ‘Extreme Reading Competition’. There are also poetry competitions for our budding young writers to enter plus many fun House activities.



Dress up for ‘World Book Day’- Thursday 6th March

Thursday 6th March will be a fancy dress day where students should come dressed as a book-related character.  We’d love to see Harry Potters, Hobbits and many other crazy characters wandering around the school that day!  A character parade and ‘best-dressed’ competition is also being arranged to decide the winning costume.

Please note that a 10RMB donation is requested and this will go towards our Charity ActionAid.



Parent art exhibition runs until Friday 14th March.

An exhibition of artwork created by our parents will run until Friday 14th March and we welcome everyone in our BSG community to come into school and enjoy the display.


Best wishes,



Mr. Iain Ruck,

Head of Secondary
