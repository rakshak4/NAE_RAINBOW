Dear Parents,



The first day of school is rapidly approaching!



As you prepare, please find some useful information below that will help ensure your child is ready for the start of the new school year.



‘Uniform Week’



We dedicate the week before school begins each year to making sure both returning and newly joining families are able to purchase all the uniform items your children will need.



During this week we will create changing rooms and sell all uniform items in the spacious gymnasium of the Nanhu Building located on the South Lake Campus (Nan Hu), assigning extra staff to assist you.



Opening times: 9am to 4pm

Dates: Monday, 18th August to Thursday, 21st August.

Where (all students): Nanhu Gym



We will continue to sell uniform in the Nanhu Gym during ‘Orientation Day &amp; &apos;Meet the Teacher Day&apos; (Friday, 22nd August) but please be aware this day is usually very busy for all parents and staff at the school so we strongly recommend you visit the school Monday to Thursday next week for all uniform requirements as school recommences this year.



From 25th August, uniform will be available, as normal, from the uniform shop located in the Nanhu building from 8:30am to 4:00pm each day the school is open.
