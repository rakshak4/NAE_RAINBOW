Dear Parents,

Next week is the start of our swimming programme for Reception and Year 1 classes. All students will be swimming during both of their PE lessons for six weeks in term 3. Lessons will start during the week beginning 12th May.

Classes will be swimming on the following days:

Reception:

Rec A (Seahorses) Tuesday &amp; Thursday

Rec B (Raccoons) Tuesday &amp; Friday

Rec C (Rabbits) Tuesday &amp; Friday

Rec D (Dragons) Tuesday &amp; Friday

Year 1:

Yr 1 A (Puffins) Monday &amp; Thursday

Yr 1 B (Bees) Tuesday &amp; Thursday

Yr 1 C (Zebras) Tuesday &amp; Friday

Yr 1 D (Elephants) Monday &amp; Friday

We ask students to wear appropriate swimwear for lessons; a blue or black one-piece swimsuit for girls (no bikinis) and blue/black swimming trunks/shorts for boys. (Long, baggy surf-style shorts are not suitable). Please note that swimming hats (any colour) are also compulsory. Swimming goggles and rash-vests may be worn and students should not forget to bring a towel, flip flops and sunscreen.

As swimming is an important aspect of the curriculum, all students will be expected to participate in swimming lessons unless parents have provided a note to excuse their absence prior to the lesson.

If you require any further information please do not hesitate to contact me at louise.ruck@bsg.org.cn
Kind regards,
Miss Lou
Lower School P.E. Coordinator
