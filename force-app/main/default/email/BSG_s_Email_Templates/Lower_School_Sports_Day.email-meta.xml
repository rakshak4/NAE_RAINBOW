Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},


As you will be aware, all students in Years 2 to 5 are currently taking their SATs papers. I know you will be keen to find out the results of these tests as quickly as possible. Teachers will begin the marking process after they have finished the tests. The Primary Management Team will also be moderating the papers to ensure consistency in the marking across the school. These necessary checks take time, ensuring a high quality summative assessment process.

As a result, test scores will be released to parents, along with the final report of the year, on Friday 21st June. An information sheet explaining what the scores mean, will be included with the report pack.

Please note that SATs only provide a snap-shot of learning. As a school, we have always placed much higher value on formative (on-going) teacher assessment. Parent consultations that you have attended and reports you have received, mean that you should have a clear indication of your child’s learning needs and progression.

However, please know that teachers are always willing to discuss results with you. If you have any questions regarding results or your child’s academic performance, our door is always open to you.


Kind regards,

Mr David Laird
Head of Primary
The British School of Guangzhou
World Class Education
