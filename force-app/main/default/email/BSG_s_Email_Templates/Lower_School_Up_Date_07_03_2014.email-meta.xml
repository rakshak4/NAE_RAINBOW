Dear Parents,
As we near the end of Term 2, I would like to provide you with some information specific to the Lower School.
Parent Meeting
On Wednesday 12th March at 10:00am there will be a Parent Meeting in the Lower School Hall. If you are able to join us on this day please note that you should enter the Lakefront compound via the G Block entrance. Please also note that once the car park directly above school is full the G Block car park should be used. For obvious safety reasons, please do not park vehicles on the road - only designated parking spaces should be used. Thank you in advance for your cooperation with this.
H1N1 Virus
By now all parents should have received advice regarding the recent outbreak of H1N1 within Guangzhou. I am pleased to confirm that we do not have any recorded cases at BSG and we would appreciate parent support with ensuring this virus is kept at bay from our school community. Therefore, if your child shows signs of fever or flu-like symptoms please do not send them to school and seek medical advice as soon as possible. We will of course keep parents fully informed of any further developments.
Reports/Parent-Teacher Consultations
You will be receiving your child’s Term 2 progress report on Friday 14th March. Parent-Teacher Consultations will take place on Monday 24th March. Please note this date in your diary. You will receive further information from your child’s teacher nearer the time to arrange an appointment time.
Book Week
The week beginning 17th March will be our annual Book Week. This week will be filled with fun, educational activities that focus upon well known authors, illustrators and stories. Each class will be decorating their classroom door as a book cover. These will be judged and the winner announced in our weekly assembly. On Thursday 20th March we will be having a fundraising non-uniform day. Children are asked to bring a donation of 10RMB and invited to come to school dressed as their favourite book character - so get those costumes ready! Please note all money raised will go towards our chosen charity Action Aid. On Friday 21st March we will be having a ‘Snuggle-up-and-Read&apos; day where the children and staff should come to school in their night wear and we will all be enjoying hot chocolate and marshmallows and bedtime stories throughout the day.
Lower School Security
I am pleased to inform you that during the April holidays closed circuit cameras will be installed on the Lower School. Plans for installation had originally been approved for during the summer holidays but Nord Anglia Education have recently approved the installation of security cameras to take place earlier than expected.
Last Week of Term 2
During the last week of term we will be inviting parents into school for a ‘Family Tea Party’. Please check your child’s communication book or year group blog for further information nearer the time. We will also be awarding certificates to  those students who have achieved 100% attendance this term. Please note that on the last day of term (Friday 28th March) school will finish at 12:00pm.
Recruitment
I am pleased to inform you that our recruitment for the academic year 2014-15 is now complete. On the Lower School we will be welcoming four British teachers who will be joining us with a wealth of both UK and International experience. I am also very pleased to announce that Mr. Gavin will become our Foundation Leader next year. He will be responsible for every aspect of the Foundation curriculum and will also be supporting me in my role as Head of Lower School. I am sure you will join me in congratulating Mr. Gavin on his new role and wishing an early welcome to our new teachers.
I am very much looking forward to our final few weeks of Term 2, especially our Book Week, which in the past has proved to be a very enjoyable week at school. If you require any further information on any of the above events please do not hesitate to contact your child’s class teacher.
Kind regards,
Miss Kathy
Head of Lower School
The British School of Guangzhou
