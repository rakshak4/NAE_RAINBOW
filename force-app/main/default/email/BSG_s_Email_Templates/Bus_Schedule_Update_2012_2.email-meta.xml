Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Please be aware that the most up-to-date bus schedule is now available on the school website.

Kindly note that changes have been made to some pick up and drop off times/locations and bus monitors&apos; contact details have been adjusted after further trials this week.

For the full schedule, please refer to the website (www.bsg.org.cn) or click here for more information.

Also, a reminder that the school day starts at 8:00 am from 20th August and there are no After School Activities (ASAs) for the first two weeks of term so school will finish at 3pm each day.

Many thanks for your understanding and support.

Kind regards,

Grace Kwan
Bus Coordinator
