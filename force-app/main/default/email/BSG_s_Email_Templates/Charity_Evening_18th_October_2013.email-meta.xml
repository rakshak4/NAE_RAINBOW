Dear Parents,&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;


Our friends from the charity association COULEURS DE CHINE are organising a Charity Dinner Dance on the 18th October 2013 to help support underprivileged children from rural China attend school. This is a charity and cause the school supports each year through our parents organisation, the Events and Fundraising Committee (EFC), and we would like to pass on an invitation for the evening to you all.
