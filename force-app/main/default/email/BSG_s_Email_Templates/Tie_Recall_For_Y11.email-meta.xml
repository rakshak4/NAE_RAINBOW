International Day 2013

Saturday, 9th November


Your Country Needs You!


Dear Parents,


International Day 2013 is one of the highlights of the School’s event calendar. It involves the entire school community as we unite to celebrate our own distinct cultures while embracing the multiculturalism that defines our school.


The day runs from 11am - 3pm on Saturday, 9th November. There will be a number of stalls, food vendors, events, games, raffles and sports competitions not to mention a wet zone, bouncy castle and an indoor creche for our younger friends to enjoy.


All are Welcome! International Day 2013 is organised by teachers and volunteers from the school. Last year over 1500 people attended. It is a wonderful day full of fun that all children and families from The British School and the wider international communities are welcome to join.


Would you like to help or take more than a visitor&apos;s role on International Day 2013?


Country Stalls or Booths: The focus of the day is to celebrate different cultures. To help with this, each year we invite parents to volunteer to help decorate or organise a Country Stall/Booth related to your region or culture. Each stall will be colourfully decorated and should provide something fun for children to enjoy (a game or something of interest always works well). If you are able to help your country, please contact Ms. Christie Greenhill (Christiedp1@gmail.com) or Ms. Gemma Campbell (Gemma.campbell@bsg.org.cn) to offer your support.


Music/Dance performance: If you would like to offer a performance, particularly if it has a National or International theme, then please contact Ms. Naomi Rowan (Naomi.rowan@bsg.org.cn) at the school.


Raffle: Parents can assist with the raffle in a number of ways. Firstly, would your company be able to provide a prize for a raffle? Secondly, by selling raffle tickets that will be sent home prior to International Day 2013. Please contact Dilek Kalkan (Dilek.s.kalkan@gmail.com) if you are able to support the raffle in any way.


Vendors: Would you like to sell or promote food or products at International Day 2013? Please contact Monika (monika2575@yahoo.co.in) if you or your friends/partners are interested (note all vendors must make a cash donation to the event of between 200rmb to 700rmb depending on type of stall).


As we continue to prepare, please book the date of 9th November into your diary and help us spread the word within the greater international community as we prepare to make International Day 2013 at the British School of Guangzhou a wonderful day for all to enjoy.


Thank you all for your continued support.


Best wishes,
