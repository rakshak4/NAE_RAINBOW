Dear Parents,

Your child is creating an exciting project for our upcoming Science Day. As part of the day’s activities the children will be participating in a science fair. For those of you unfamiliar with the concept, a science fair is where children complete an investigation and showcase the process and results visually for others to see with a presentation and display. Prizes will be awarded for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place in assembly that week.

Our science fair will take place on February 27th at 2:00pm. Parents are warmly invited to come to school at that time and have a look at all of the projects ‘in action’. Refreshments will be available for your enjoyment after the event.

Each project must include the following:

•           A scientific question or problem to investigate

•           A hypothesis

•           A method to show how you are going to test your hypothesis

•           The data you collected

•           The results drawn from your data

•           A conclusion

•           A visual display created to show others your findings

•           Picture/photographic evidence of the investigation

Each project will be judged on:

•           Application of scientific knowledge and skills

•           Originality of investigation

•           Quality, clarity and neatness of presentation and display

For inspiration, simply search on the internet for ‘science fair projects’ and lots of ideas will be available for your child to consider. Projects need to be brought into school on February 26th to allow us time to set up the fair for the next day.

Thanks for your support and I look forward to seeing Year 5 &amp; 6 produce outstanding work for Science Day 2013!

Yours sincerely,

Brian Schroeder
