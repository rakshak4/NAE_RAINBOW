Dear Parents,


Baker Books International Book Sale - Summer Term


We are offering students from all year groups, Pre-Nursery to Year 6, the chance to purchase books from the Baker Books International School Book Club this term. Please look through the Summer Term catalogue we have sent home with your child and place your order online (see below for details).


The club is designed specifically for young readers (ages 3 - 16) and has a fantastic selection of fiction and non-fiction books from lots of our favourite authors.


Having access to a wide variety of books can help children develop their reading and writing skills and build a lifelong love of reading - that is why we’re sending home the latest Baker Books catalogue which has a wide range of carefully selected children’s books for you and your family to choose from.


Another reason for ordering is that the school receives a percentage of the total order value in free books so by purchasing your books from the catalogue, you are also helping your child’s class and school library!


Please note that prices are in GBP and already include all postage and import/customs fees. All orders must be completed online; no cash orders will be accepted at school.


How to Order

Ø Go to http://parentpay.bakerbooks.co.uk/clubs/BRICHA5 or click HERE

Ø Enter your child’s name and select their class

Ø Choose your books from the Funfare catalogue (age 3-8) and/or Book Zone catalogue (age 9-16)

Ø Pay securely online using your personal debit or credit card via WorldPay

Ø Books will be received at school and sent home with your child

Ø Orders must be received online by Wednesday 30th April


We hope you enjoy looking through the catalogues and choosing your books online - it’s a great way to broaden your child’s experience of reading.
