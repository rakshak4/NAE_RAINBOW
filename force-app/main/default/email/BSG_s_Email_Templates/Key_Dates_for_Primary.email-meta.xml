Dear Parents,



The Secondary Charity Committee will be holding a &apos;Bring and Buy a Book Sale&apos; on Friday, 1st November at lunch time for Primary and Secondary students to be held in the Upper School Library. Students are encouraged to donate a book they have finished reading and buy a new one. There will be a minimum donation of 5 RMB for each book.



The money raised will be going to a charity called ‘Room to Read’ (www.roomtoread.org). The charity works to provide education to those in remote parts of the world. &apos;Room to Read’s programmes have benefitted more than 7.8 million children so far and we are on track to have helped 10 million under privileged children by 2015.  Imagine a world in which every child has access to an education. ‘Room to Read’ is doing its best to make this dream a reality, one child at a time.



Parents and staff are also welcome to bring books in for the event, as well as purchasing donated books.



Thank you very much for your ongoing support to the school&apos;s Charity Committee.



Kindest regards.



Amanda Boby (Community Action and Fundraising Coordinator) &amp; Emily Hardwick (Secondary English KS3 Lead Teacher).
