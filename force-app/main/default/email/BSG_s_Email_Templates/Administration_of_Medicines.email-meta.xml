Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Can we please remind you that if your child needs to take medication during the day that you send the medicine in a sealed bag or container clearly labelled with your child&apos;s name and class. It is recommended that you pass all medicines directly to your child&apos;s bus supervisor or Miss Patience on the front desk.

In addition to this we ask that you also complete the attached &apos;medicine approval&apos; form to ensure our school nurse is fully informed regarding the administration of the medicine.

If your child needs to take any medication for a contagious condition please keep them at home until they are fully recovered.

Thank you for your support with this.

Miss Kathy

Head of Lower School
The British School of Guangzhou
