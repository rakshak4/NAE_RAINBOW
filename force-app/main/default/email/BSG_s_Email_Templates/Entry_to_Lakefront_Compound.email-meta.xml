Dear Lower School Parents,
Due to the building work for the new Gate House, Lakefront management have decided to close the main entrance to the compound for safety reasons.
Please note that until 10th March entry to the compound will be via G Block.
Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience caused and thank you in advance for your support with this matter.
Kind regards,

Miss Kathy
Head of Lower School
The British School of Guangzhou
