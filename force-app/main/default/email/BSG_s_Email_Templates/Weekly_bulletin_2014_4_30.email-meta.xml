Bulletin – Week Beginning Monday, 5th May 2014


Dear Parents,



Farewell to Year 11

This week we bid a fond farewell to our Year 11 students. We are extremely proud of these students, many of whom have been with us since Year 7 and we are delighted that many will be returning back to study A-levels at BSG. I wish all of our senior students the best of luck with their exams. Year 12 also start their study leave today and will return for University application day on Friday, 13th June 2014.



Key Stage 3 Challenge- Student to Teacher

This week has been an extremely hectic week for our Key Stage 3 students as they have been busy completing in a House Challenge- ‘Student to Teacher’. In groups, the students had one day to prepare a 50-minute lesson in English, Maths, Geography, Art, PSHE or History, which they delivered the following day to a class of excitable Year 4 students. This was quite a challenge for many of our students and demanded maximum effort and group work if they were to be successful. If this was not already difficult enough, each House also had to prepare a 7 minute assembly on the topic ‘Being a good student’ which they presented to Year 4 at the end of the challenge.



The challenge proved to be a big hit with both the Key Stage 3 and the Year 4 and everyone celebrated with an outdoor BBQ lunch. Students who particularly stood out for exceptional effort during their lessons were Sarah Ryan, Kate Kielty, Rachel Moon, Jazzie Greenhill, Bethany J, Amy Wong, Kevin L, Breton Lim, Jojo Guo, Max Siegel, Lisa Riensche, Keisha R.



The results from the challenge were as follows:

1st Normans

2nd Romans

3rd Saxons &amp; Vikings



School Prom

The James Bond themed, Senior school prom went ahead on Saturday, 26th April and was extremely successful. The event was predominantly student-organized (with assistance from Miss Welch and Mr. Ellis) and they should be extremely proud of the fantastic job that they did. Andrea Solis and Kelly Wong were the two students that were most actively involved but they were supported by a number of others from our student body. I would also like to pass my thanks to our three main sponsors; EFC (Gold), Four winds (Silver) and Hooleys (Bronze). There are photos from the prom in the entrance to the reception area on Nanhu site.



ASAs

Please note that ASAs will continue (week 3) from Monday, 5th May.



Non-Uniform day

The school held a non-uniform day to day with the money going towards the Music Festival that we be held on Friday, 13th June 2014. This will be a charity event and the money raised from this will be given to Action Aid. Unfortunately, today’s event was not mentioned in last week’s bulletin.
