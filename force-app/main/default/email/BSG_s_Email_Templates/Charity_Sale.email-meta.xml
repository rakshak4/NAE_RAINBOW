Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

The Guangdong FAO is organising a Charity Sale this Saturday in the Northern Square of Grandview Plaza to raise money for the Guangdong Rehabilitation Centre for Disabled Children.  The event runs from 1000 until 1600.  The money raised will go towards helping young children (aged 0-6) with hearing impairments get treatment and support.

This is a worthwhile event in a good cause, so if youâ€™re free, please come along.

Regards,

Tracey
