Dear Parents,
Another frantically busy, but fun week has passed us by at the Lower School.
Book Week
Everyone had such a fantastic week! Lots of reading and literacy experiences were held, with many parents coming into school to read stories to the children. The school was a rainbow of colours on Thursday for our costume day, with a much calmer day on Friday when both staff and students came to school in their pyjamas for a relaxing day of reading bedtime stories with milk, hot chocolate, marshmallows and cookies.
Action Aid
Our chosen charity ‘Action Aid’ was a focus of ours last week. The Year 1 (Zebras and Elephants classes) Bake Sale raised 1,167RMB and the Book Week costume day raised 1,185RMB. Both these amounts will help towards supporting the education of children in remote rural areas of China. Many thanks to all parents for their support and a special thank you to the parents who came to school to help with the Bake Sale.
Evacuation Procedure
Every term we have at least one evacuation practice to ensure we are fully prepared in the case of an emergency. Last week we had an impromptu practice when the alarms were activated suddenly. I am pleased to inform you that everyone evacuated the school premises in a calm and controlled manner. A huge thank you to both staff and students for their rapid response and sensible behaviour during our latest practice.
Family Tea Parties
To celebrate the forthcoming British Mother’s Day we will be holding ‘Family Tea Parties&apos; this week. We hope you are able to attend your child’s tea party to enable them to show you how much they care. Please check communication books for further details.
Attendance
An important part of your child’s schooling is attendance. We will be celebrating all those children who have achieved full attendance this term in Thursday’s assembly, with certificates being awarded to those who have achieved 100% attendance this term.
Second Hand Uniform Sales
Throughout this final week of school we will be having a Second Hand Uniform Sale stall. If you would like to purchase high quality uniform items at a reduced cost please visit the main reception area of the Lower School. If you have any unwanted uniform items at home that are still of a high quality and you would like to support the second hand uniform stall please send any items to school. All money raised from the second hand stall will go to Action Aid.
Last Day of Term
Friday 28th March is the last day of term and school will finish at 12:00pm. This will be a non-uniform day for both children and staff.
Happy Holidays!
All that is left to say is to wish everyone a very happy holidays and on behalf of all the staff we thank you for your support this term and look forward to seeing the children on Monday 7th April for the start of Term 3.
Kind regards,
Miss Kathy
Head of Lower School
The British School of Guangzhou
