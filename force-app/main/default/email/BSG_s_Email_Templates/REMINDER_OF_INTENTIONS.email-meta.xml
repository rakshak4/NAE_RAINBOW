Dear Parents,


Following our email to you on the 12th March 2014, this is a gentle reminder for you to inform our Admissions Department (admissions@bsg.org.cn) of your intentions to leave or stay with the school next academic year (commencing 25th August 2014).


Please note, if you intend to leave us and notice of withdrawal is received after 28th March 2014, your family will NOT be eligible for the &apos;Early Notice Payback&apos; payment scheme and any student deposits held by the school will be forfeited.


If you have already informed our Admissions Department of your intentions, we would like to thank you and ask that you kindly disregard this email.


Kind regards,


Admissions Team
