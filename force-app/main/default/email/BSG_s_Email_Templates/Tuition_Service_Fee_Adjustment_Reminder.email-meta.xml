Dear Parents,


We would like to remind you of changes to our fee structure that will be applied from Term 1, 2014/15. These changes were announced to parents on 31st March, 2014. Please CLICK HERE to read the original email from Mr. Thomas. Here are the main points:



Tuition fees for 2014/15 have been increased by an average of just over 4%

A 5% discount is available for yearly payments

Termly fee payments have been adjusted to recognise a longer term 1 so annually, fees are now split more fairly over the three school terms (Term 1=40%, Term 2=30% and Term 3 = 30%)

Bus fees have been increased by 3%

No increases have been applied to lunch fees

Exam fees are now fully covered within standard tuition fees (this includes all IGCSE and A-Level fees applied from external examination boards)

Costs of normal Residential trips and 1-1 devices will continue to be covered within standard tuition fees.
