Dear Parent,&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;

The introduction of the iPad mini scheme in key stage 3 has been an on-going success this year. Students have been benefiting from the support and additional curriculum activities that the iPad mini can provide and there has been a noticeable improvement in engagement during lessons.

I would like to take this time to remind parents that the iPad mini contract states that students should download and install the required school apps. Without the correct apps installed, students will be unable to access the curriculum and participate in lessons. Please click here for the list of iPad mini apps that we currently use in class.

Teachers continually look for new apps that will enhance the educational experience for our students. Hence teachers may request additional apps that are free during the remainder of the year, but they will give ample notice for this to be done. If teachers require any new paid apps then they will notify parents by email and/or letter. The list of paid apps will be no more than 60USD, as agreed by the contract.

You will notice that iMovie, Garageband, Pages and Keynote are now free on the new iOS 7.0.6

If you have any concerns about the download and installation of apps, please do not hesitate to contact Miss Fish at debra.fish@bsg.org.cn

If you have any behavioral or iPad misuse concerns, please do not hesitate to contact Mr Ellis at robert.ellis@bsg.org.cn

Yours sincerely,

Debra Fish
