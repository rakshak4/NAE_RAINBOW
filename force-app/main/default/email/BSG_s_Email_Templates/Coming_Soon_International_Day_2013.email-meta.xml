Dear Parents and Friends,


The British School of Guangzhou is excited to announce a day of fun for families from the international community will be held at the school on Saturday, 9th November 2013 from 11am to 3pm.


The event will be organised by our EFC (The Events and Fundraising Committee), the school’s parent volunteer association, and is expected to attract a large number of families from the greater international community. It is one of the major social days in the school calendar with over 1500 people attending last year.


This annual event has the theme of an &apos;International Day&apos;, with lots of parents and teachers from different countries (over 50 at the school!) show casing the many and varied cultures we have at our school. There will be delicious international food available, plus lots of games, activities, stalls, vendors and stage performances for all your family to enjoy throughout the day. All money raised on the day will go directly to the EFC for donation at the end of the year to charitable and worthwhile causes. In recent years these have included Action Aid, Hopeful Hearts and the on-going sponsorship of underprivileged children through the charity Couleurs De Chine.

Can You or Your Company Help?


One of the main attractions of the day will be a ‘Prize Draw Raffle’ held on the centre stage. As we work to prepare for this we would like to send out a request to companies, organisations or indeed anyone with charity on their mind, to please support us through donations of raffle prizes that you feel our students and community would enjoy.


To help show our appreciation for donations, we have put together below some sponsorship opportunities available to anyone interested in supporting International Day 2013. In addition, if any individual or company would like to become an exclusive lead sponsor or partner, please do let us know.


If you are able and willing to support this year, please contact Priyanka Kundnani through priyankavijay213@gmail.com.


Calling all Vendors and Stall Holders!


We would like to inform anyone who would like to set up a stall or booth on International Day, we are now welcome to applications with a donation of 200rmb to 1000rmb (depending on type of booth/stall) required to secure a place. Please note allocation of stalls will be on a first-come, first-serve basis with limited availability so please contact us early to avoid disappointment.


If you are interested in setting up a vendor stall, please contact Mrs. Monika Agarwal through monika2575@yahoo.co.in.


More on International Day 2013 will follow soon but for now, a huge thank you to all parents and our friends from the business community for supporting us in past years and we’ll look forward to making this year&apos;s event even bigger and better for all our children and friends to enjoy.


Best wishes,



Dilek Kalkan &amp; Christie Greenhill
