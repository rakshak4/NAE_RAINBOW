Dear Parents,



Recently some of you have used the school bus service after attending meetings or events at school. Please note, the school bus service is exclusively for children.



Parents are not permitted to use the school bus service unless prior written permission has been sought from the school and the bus coordinator, Ms. Claire Guo (Claire@bsg.org.cn), has been informed.



As always, we respectfully appreciate your cooperation.



Kind regards,



The Administration Team







The British School of Guangzhou
