Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

OLD TOYS AND BOOKS WANTED!

Whyville Education is celebrating their 3rd Anniversary. To celebrate they have teamed up with GWIC chairity coordinators and BSG to hold a charity sale.

We will be accepting donations at the school this week only and will pass all donations to GWIC and Whyville representatives Friday, 21st September.

The proceeds from the sale (plus any unsold items) will be donated to Guangzhou&apos;s Children Migrant Center, an organisation that GWIC is supporting to help migrant children.

The charity sale is this weekend with BSG students visiting the Migrant Children Center on Sunday 23rd September to make donations.

Thank you in advance for support.
