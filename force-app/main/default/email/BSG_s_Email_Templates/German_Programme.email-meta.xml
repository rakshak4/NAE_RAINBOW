Dear parents,


I am very pleased to inform you that we have recently recruited a German native language teacher to BSG for the coming academic year. Anne Morgan is an experienced teacher of German and for the last 3 years has been responsible for delivering a German language curriculum at Utahloy school.


Anne will be responsible for providing a native German programme for any German students who require it and will be asked to set up a German MFL programme for non-native speakers interested in learning an alternative European language. We are very pleased to have recruited someone with Anneâ€™s experience and are looking forward to welcoming her to BSG.


The introduction of German onto our curriculum is in line with our plans to expand language opportunities for our students over the next 3 years. Please feel free to contact me directly at mark.thomas@bsg.org.cn if you would like more information.


Regards,


Mark Thomas


Principal
