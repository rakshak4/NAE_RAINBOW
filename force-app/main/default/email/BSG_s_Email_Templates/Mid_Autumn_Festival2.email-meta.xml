Friday, 29th August

Dear Parents,


Friday 5th September 2014 will be the last day before our Mid-Autumn festival break.  The Chinese Department kindly ask all school students to come to school dressed in either their traditional Chinese costumes, or red, yellow or gold clothing to help create a fun festival atmosphere. We will be having a Mid-Autumn Festival themed lunch including some Chinese dishes and Chinese desert on Friday.


Please note school will be closed on Monday 8th September.


Regards,


Dan Wang

Head of Chinese Department


The British School of Guangzhou
