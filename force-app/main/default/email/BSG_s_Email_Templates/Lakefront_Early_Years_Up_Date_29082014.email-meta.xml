Dear Lakefront Early Years Parents, (Pre-Nursery, Nursery &amp; Reception),&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;

As our first week of school draws to an end I am pleased to inform you that the children have all had a wonderful week in school. Walking around the school I can see the children are happy, engaged and having lots of fun. I am very much looking forward to the year ahead!

Please note some important information I would like to make you aware of:

Naming Uniforms and All School Items

Can you please ensure that all uniform items are labelled and that your child wears the correct uniform for school everyday. This includes footwear, black shoes with the summer uniform and white trainers with the P.E. uniform. Please do not send your child to school wearing Crocs or brightly coloured footwear.

Please ensure water bottles are named and if your child is in Reception, please label their snack boxes clearly.

Parent Support Group (PSG)

I would like to thank all those parents who have volunteered to become a Class Parent Representative and become and member of our Early Years Parent Support Group. I will be inviting you for a Social Meeting on Wednesday 17th September, of which more information will follow shortly.

Arrival and Collection Times

I would like to remind you that children should arrive promptly at 8:00am ready for registration and morning lessons to begin. In the afternoon school finishes at 3:00pm. If you are going to be late collecting your child please inform the school.

Parking and Road Safety

The safety of all our students is of the utmost importance to us and to ensure families arrive and leave school safely I must ask that you do not stop or park you cars on the road outside of school. Please use the car park above school and walk down into the school grounds. If you walk your child to school please use the paths and zebra crossings available, please do not walk your child on the road.

Chinese Celebration Day

On Friday 5th September we have our Chinese Mid-Autumn celebration. The children will be doing lots of fun activities and will enjoy a delicious Chinese lunch and snacks. To help celebrate this festival we invite children to come to school dressed in Chinese costumes or anything in the colour of red, yellow or gold. We shall look forward to a very colourful day!

Nursery Students

Please note that from next week our Nursery children will be staying full days. Please remember to bring the requested bedding for their &apos;quiet timeâ€™ which will take place after lunchtime.

I hope your children have been coming home with lovely stories of their first week at school. It is delightful to see how quickly they have settled and how eager they are to start learning.

Kind regards,
Miss Kathy
Katherine Weir-Davis
Head of Lakefront Early Years Campus
