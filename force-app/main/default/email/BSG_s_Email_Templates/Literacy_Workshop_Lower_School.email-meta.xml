Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

At BSG we understand that the teaching of Literacy skills is paramount to the overall development of the children within the Lower School. For this reason we would like to offer a ‘Literacy Workshop’ which will include presentations on:

How we facilitate language acquisition
How we teach pre-reading and writing skills
Ways you can support and develop your child’s early literacy skills at home

The workshop will take place in the Lower School Hall on Wednesday 30th January from 3:00pm–4:00pm. The school will provide supervision in the new Activity Room between the above times to enable children to play safely whilst parents attend the workshop. The Coffee Shop will also be open for a relaxing drink after the workshop.

It would be appreciated if you could complete the information slip that your child will bring home today and return it to school. If your child will not be taking their usual bus home on this day please inform our bus coordinator at the following address grace.kwan@bsg.org.cn

The Lower School team will look forward to seeing you all at the workshop.

Kind regards,

Miss Kathy
Head of Lower School
The British School of Guangzhou
