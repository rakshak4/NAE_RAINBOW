Dear Lower School Parents,
Despite the rain during the night, we will be continuing with our planned Sports Day events today:
Pre-Nursery and Nursery 9:00-10:30am
Reception and Year 1 - 1:00-2:30pm
We are hoping very much it does not rain for us today, however, if it does rain during our activities the teacher on your childâ€™s activity will inform you which area of the school to go to for a continuation of the races. The final presentation event will take place in the Hall.
If you are able to join us for the Sports Day please note that you should use the G Block car park at Lakefront.
Kind regards,
Miss Kathy
Head of Lower School
The British School of Guangzhou
