    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

I attach a powerpoint for the Year 7 Trip to Hainan. The itinerary is provisional, whilst we await confirmation of the flight bookings. I attach details of those flights and the staff going with each group.


Upon confirmation of the flight details, we will send a revised itinerary and kit list.


Concerns have been raised about safety and the water based activities. We can assure you that BSG staff:pupil ratio is more than adequate for each trip and we will ensure that Insight Adventures provide adequate staff:pupil ratio for each water based activity.


Please email sean.mcadam@bsg.org.cn if you have any concerns or general questions about the trip.


Kind regards,


Mr.Sean McAdam</textOnly>
