Dear Parents of Pre-Nursery and Nursery Children,


I hope you are well and excited about starting the new school year at BSG.


The school bus schedule for 2013/14 is now available through our website (http://www.bsg.org.cn/en/school-services/school-buses.aspx). Please check your route and times carefully before the bus service begins tomorrow Tuesday, 20th August.


Note: for PN and N students we will provide a NOON Bus Service. When viewing the PN and N bus schedule the &apos;First Week Noon Bus Schedule&apos; (AVAILABLE HERE) is for both PN and N students during the first week of the school year only. The &apos;Termly Noon Bus Schedule&apos; (AVAILABLE HERE) is for students who will take the noon bus service after the first week of school.


Bus routes are now fixed so if you require use of the school bus service, a route from published bus schedules should be chosen.


Should you have any questions regarding the school bus service, please contact Rainbow Chen (rainbow@bsg.org.cn) directly at your convenience.
