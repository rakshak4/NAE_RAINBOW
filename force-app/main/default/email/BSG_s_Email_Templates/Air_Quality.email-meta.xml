Bulletin – &lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;

New Term Week Beginning Monday 13th January 2014



Dear Parents,



Welcome back everyone and I hope you all had an enjoyable Christmas break with your families and friends. I am sure our students are feeling refreshed after a particularly busy last term.



ASAs

The ASAs begin this week and so buses will be departing at 4pm from Monday 13th January. Students have now all received confirmation of their ASA choices.



Year 11 Mock Exams

The mock exams will begin on Monday 13th January and all students are expected to come to school during this time as normal and will be using Mr Howe’s classroom for quiet study. We must have prior written and signed consent from parents in planners if they are happy for their child to leave school premises when they are not in an exam. On a day during when a student has no exams they are not expected in school and can study at home.



Students will receive their mock exam results collectively when they return on a specific results day and so they are asked not to approach individual teachers during the exam period for their results.



Reports:

Please be aware that Cycle 2 reports will go home for all year groups with the exception of Year 9 and 11 on Friday, 17th January. These year groups will have a later, full report to assist with option choices that they may wish to make, and, in the case of Year 11, to provide feedback about their mock performance and any last targets in the build up to their examinations.



Curriculum Letters

All students have received a letter to take home outlining what they will be learning in each of their subjects this coming term. We feel it is important to keep students and parents up to date with the learning that is taking place in our classrooms.



Online Safety

The safe and appropriate use of online forums and social networking sites continues to be a concern for us. We are particularly concerned with the type of language used by students online. We will continue to monitor this through spot checks and act accordingly when we receive any concerns from students or parents.
