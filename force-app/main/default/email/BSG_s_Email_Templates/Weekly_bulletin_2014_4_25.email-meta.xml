Bulletin: Week Beginning Monday, 28th April 2014




Dear Parents,


Farewell to Mrs. Grice Glover – Maternity Leave

The school would like to say farewell to Mrs. Grice Glover as she and her husband return to the U.K. for the final stages of her pregnancy. The PE department has made excellent progress under her stewardhip and I would like to express my thanks to her for this. I’m sure that all our families will wish her all the best. Mrs. Grice Glover was visited by a number of her Year 9 class who baked her a cake and her Year 7 class gave her a fitting send off.


Please note that this means that there will be changes to the PE department for the remainder of term. Firstly, Mr. Furniss will be the Acting Head of Department in recognition of the work that he has done in the PE department for the past 4 years. We are also very fortunate to have secured the services of a UK qualified PE teacher to act as a temporary replacement for Mrs. Grice Glover. Ms. E. Smyth will be with us for the remainder of the year and has been in this week meeting classes to ensure a easy transition. Finally, Ms. Kara Wutzke will also be helping to cover PE classes for part of the week and we are confident that the PE programme will not be disturbed by the change in personnel.


School closed – May Holiday

Please note that the school is closed on Thursday and Friday, 29-30th April as we celebrate the Mayday holiday. School resumes on Monday, 5th May.


Leavers’ assembly / Study leave begins:

Please note that Year 11 will be making a Leaver’s assembly on Wednesday to say goodbye to the school as they embark on examination leave prior to their IGCSE examinations. Year 12 students will also be on exam leave at this time prior to their AS examinations.


Residential Letters:

Please can parents ensure that the emergency contact details are completed and returned to form tutors by Monday, 28th April. This will allow the school to book flights and confirm the exact days of travel. Please can parents also inform the form tutor if their child is not attending the trip. I have attached copies below, please click on the link to the appropriate trip.

There will be a parent-teacher conference on Monday, 28th April for Year 7 and 8 parents. This will be taking place in the gym between 4pm-7pm and parents are welcome to drop in anytime during the evening and meet with the relevant teachers.



Year 10 trip to Honda

Year 10 Business and Geography students will be visiting a Honda factory on Tuesday 29th April to see first hand how the company operates. It is important that our students gain real life experience in the subjects they are studying. Students will leave school at 8:15am and return at 11:25am in time for period 5&amp;6.



Key Stage 3 Two Day House Challenge

Our Key Stage 3 students (Years 7-9) will be taking part in a House challenge during Monday and Tuesday. During this time students will not be in normal lessons and instead will be involved in various fun and challenging competitions to earn important House points. Students should be wearing their House shirts during these two days with their usual school trousers/skirts and shoes. Lessons will resume on Wednesday as normal before breaking up for the holiday.

There are no ASAs this coming week so buses will be departing at 3pm. ASAs will recommence on Monday, May 5th.
