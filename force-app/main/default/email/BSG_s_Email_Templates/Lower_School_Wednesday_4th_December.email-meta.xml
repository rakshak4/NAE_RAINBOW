Dear Parents,&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;

Due to unplanned electrical outage the lower campus has no power for the rest of the day. We need to send all children home. Buses will be departing lower school campus at 11:15am. Parents please be ready to collect your children from 11:15 onwards from your home bus stop. Collected children need to be collected from now onwards from the lower school.

If you are unable to collect your child from school or the bus stop please inform Miss Patience by phone as soon as possible via telephone number 87094788.

Many thanks for your understanding,

Lower School
