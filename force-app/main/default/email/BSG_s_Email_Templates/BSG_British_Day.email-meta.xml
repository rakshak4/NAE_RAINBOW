Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},


A gentle reminder that the Secondary SingUp! will be taking place at BSG this Saturday (1st June). All secondary choir members need to arrive at school for 12.45pm with their full school uniform and a packed dinner.

All are welcome to come to the concert in the evening, with refreshments being served from 6.30pm onwards.  The BSG Senior choir will be performing alongside students from Clifford and Utahloy Schools in this exciting evening of music.

Thank you once again for your continued support.

Kind regards,

Naomi Rowan
Head of Secondary  Music and Performing Arts
The British School of Guangzhou
