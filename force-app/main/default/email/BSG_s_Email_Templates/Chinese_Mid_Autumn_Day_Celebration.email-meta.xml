Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

I am writing to inform you that Ms Humphreys has had to leave the school due to personal reasons and unfortunately she will be unable to return in the near future.

Her class has temporarily been spilt between Mr. Moore and Mr Bartonâ€™s classes.

In the longer term, we are in the process of employing a UK trained teacher to provide supply cover up until the Christmas period. This will allow us time to recruit a permanent teacher from the UK.

I appreciate that this not an ideal situation, but please be assured that we will do everything possible to ensure that the quality of teaching and learning for your child is unaffected.

If you have any questions with regard to the points I have raised in this letter, do not hesitate to contact me on david.laird@bsg.org.cn

Thank you for your understanding.

Regards,


David Laird
Head of Primary
The British School of Guangzhou
