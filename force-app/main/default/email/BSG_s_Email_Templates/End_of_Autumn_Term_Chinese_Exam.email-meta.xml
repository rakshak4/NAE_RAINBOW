Dear Year 1 to Year 9 CAL and CFL parents,


The Chinese Department is going to arrange an End of Term Chinese Exam for all CAL and CFL students from Year 1 to Year 9.


Chinese teachers will start preparing the students by reviewing all they have learnt in their Chinese lessons this year. It would be appreciated if you could encourage your child to review what they have studied at home.


The dates for the exams are as follows:


Y1---Wednesday, 4th December, 9:00-9:40

Y2+3---Tuesday, 3rd December, 13:00-14:00


Y4+5---Thursday, 5th December, 10:00-11:00

Y6---Wednesday, 4th December, 13:00-14:00

Y7---Friday, 6th December, 8:30-9:45


Y8+9---Wednesday, 4th December, 11:25-12:40


If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact your childâ€™s Chinese teacher.


Regards,


Alison Liu


Head of Chinese Department
