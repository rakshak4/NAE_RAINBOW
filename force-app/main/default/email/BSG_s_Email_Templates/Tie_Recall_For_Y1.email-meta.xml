Dear Year 2/3 Parents,&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; /&gt;


I would like to inform you that due to concerns regarding the quality and safety of the new design of school tie, we will be recalling all ties with a plastic clip and ordering a new design.


Children have had their ties replaced today in school. However, if you have spares at home, please bring these into school to have them replaced.


Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience caused.


Kind regards,


David Laird

(Head of Primary School)

The British School of Guangzhou
