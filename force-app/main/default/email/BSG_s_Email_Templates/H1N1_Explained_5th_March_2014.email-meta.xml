Dear Parents,


We have been informed that Utahloy International School has reported a confirmed case of the H1N1 virus in a student. While this is not a cause for major concern at this point, we would like to reassure our families that the British School is taking sensible precautions to prevent the spread of flu viruses. This is extended to our catering and bus contractors who are aware of the need to ensure our high hygiene and food quality standards are as rigorous as possible especially when flu is prevalent.


We firmly believe a well informed student and parent body can help reduce risks from flu viruses and would like to request all parents take a few minutes to read a one page fact sheet that will help you better understand the H1N1 virus.


Please CLICK HERE to access the fact sheet.


Do note that any child showing signs of flu should not be sent to school and we strongly advise medical advice is sought quickly if you suspect your child may have flu symptoms.


Kind regards,



The British School of Guangzhou
