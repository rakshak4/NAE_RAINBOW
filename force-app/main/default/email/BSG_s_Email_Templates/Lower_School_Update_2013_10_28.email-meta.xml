Dear Lower School Parents,

I hope this email finds you well and you have had an enjoyable weekend!

I would like to take this opportunity to inform you of some of the events that have taken place recently and some general Lower School information:

Year 1 Reading Workshop

On Wednesday 30th October the Year 1 parents are invited to school between 3:15-4:00pm for a reading workshop which will be presented by Mr Gavin and the Year 1 team. There will be supervision in the Activity Room for those of you who would like their children to stay at school until the workshop has finished. Please contact your child&apos;s teacher if you will be attending the workshop and if your child will not be taking the bus home on that day.

New Front Desk Person

I am pleased to announce that we have a new Front Desk person on the Lower School. Gabby He joins us to help assist Miss Patience in the smooth running of the lower campus. Ultimately Miss Gabby will replace Miss Patience as she steps into a new role within our administration team. I would like to extend a warm welcome to Gabby and wish Patience all the best in her new role.

Uniform

As the cooler weather approaches I would like to remind you of the importance of the children coming to school in the correct uniform. For the girls they should wear white tights with the summer dress rather than leggings and all children should wear a BSG cardigan or jumper rather than a casual jacket/jumper from home. We will be changing to the winter uniform on 11th November, if you require any uniform items please contact our uniform officer.

Council of International Schools (CIS)

In an effort to continually improve our school we recently received a visit from the Council of International Schools, CIS and as a result have been granted membership to CIS. As a CIS Member School, we will gain access to current practices and innovative ideas shared by other Members to inform and improve our own school community. Dr. Graham Ranger visited both campuses, went into classrooms, and met with key staff, students and parents.  Over the coming two year CIS will visit us regularly to enable us to gain further accreditation.

Staff Training

At the beginning of the year all new members of staff receive training for our interactive whiteboards and with the guidance of Miss Prerna, who is our official IWB Trainer, they all aim to reach the Level 1 qualification by Christmas. I am very pleased to inform you that on Thursday three representatives from Promethean (The company who provides our IWBs and software) visited the school to present all our new teachers and TAs with their Level 1 certificates. In addition to this our existing members of staff are all working hard to reach the next level of IWB skills. This training is of great importance as our IWBs continue to be a great teaching tool within the classroom providing children with stimulating and challenging opportunities using ICT.

In addition to our IWB training programme staff recently attended a First Aid course to ensure everyone is fully informed and prepared in cases of emergency.

Lakefront Car Park

I would like to remind parents who use the Lakefront car park to ensure you follow the one way system. It would also be appreciated if you could refrain from stopping your car anywhere except a designated parking space. For obvious safety reasons your continued support and understanding in this matter is much appreciated.

Nord Anglia Education (NAE) Visit

On Monday 28th and Tuesday 29th October we have three representatives from NAE visiting the school. This visit will give our new proprietors an opportunity to see how the school runs on a day to day basis, they will be visiting a variety of lessons across the school, meeting with students, key members of staff and a group of parent representatives. We are all looking forward to welcoming them to BSG and hope they enjoy their visit.

Halloween

On Friday 1st November the Lower School will be celebrating Halloween. Throughout the day the children will be participating in a variety of fun activities, there will be a Halloween Parade and a Disco in the afternoon organised by the EFC. Please send your child to school on this day in either a Halloween themed costume or any other kind of costume. Please also remember to send 20RMB into school for a Halloween Goody Bag provided by the EFC.

Term 1 Reports

On Friday 15th November Reception and Year 1 reports will be sent home. Please note Pre-Nursery and Nursery reports will go home on a different date to be confirmed soon. On Monday 18th November all parents will be invited into school to meet with their child&apos;s class teacher and teaching assistant to discuss the report. A letter inviting you to choose a convenient time on will be sent home soon.

International Day

I am pleased to inform you that preparations for the forthcoming International Day are well underway and everyone is getting excited as this enjoyable day draws near. The Lower School children will open the event at 11:00am by singing two songs on the main stage. Please ensure you arrive just before 11:00am and send children straight to the main stage for their performance. I hope you have all saved the date in your dairy - Saturday 9th November between 11:00am-3:00pm at the Nanhu Campus.

As you can see, we are as busy as ever on the Lower School with many more events and activities taking place over the coming weeks. I shall look forward to seeing you all on International Day which we hope will be a bright and sunny day!

Kindest regards,

Miss Kathy
Head of Lower School
