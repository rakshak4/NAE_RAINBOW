Bulletin – Week Beginning Monday 26th May 2014


Dear Parents,



Residential trips: Urgent

Please click here for the trip letter.

Please can each student attending a trip (with the exception of the Germany trip) send a photo to their form tutor of their passport information page / ID card that they will be using to travel to the residential trip. The deadline for this information is Monday, 8:30am. There is a risk that the student may not be allowed to fly if the name on their ticket is different to the name on their travel document. The school obviously wishes to avoid this potential problem and we need to have this completed as quickly as possible. Please note that any future expenses caused by incorrect or insufficient information provided by parents to the school will be the responsibility of the parents.



Advanced warning: Parents meeting, Wednesday, 4th June 2014

Please note that two parents meetings are planned for Wednesday, 4th June 2014. There is a separate letter (please click here) that gives more detailed information. The purposes of the meeting are as follows:

1) To highlight changes the Key stage 3 language programme next year.

(please see attached letter)

2) Introducing and recruit for Parent support groups for next academic year.

3) An opportunity for parents to discuss issues within the secondary schools.



Please note that Year 6 parents are receiving this bulletin as they may wish to attend this meeting with regard to languages changes. There will be a special Year 6 meeting as part of our orientation day on Friday, 22nd August, just prior to the start of the new school year on Monday, 25th August.



International Award (IA) presentation evening- Wednesday, 28th May

On Wednesday we will be hosting our first International Award presentation evening. Parents of both the current bronze IA students and those who are interested in their child completing the award next year are encouraged to attend and share in this celebration.



The evening will consist of two parts with the first being held in the reception area from 6:30pm. Here parents can indulge in drinks and nibbles whilst walking around to view what each pupil has done to complete the skill, physical and service section of the award.  At 7pm we will move into the theatre for student presentations on their adventurous trekking journey in Hong Kong.  We look forward to seeing you there.



Exam Week (Monday, 26th May- Fri 30th May) - Years 7-10

Exams are scheduled throughout the week and when they are not sitting exams, students will be attending classes as normal.



Junior Prom (Friday, 6th June) – Years 7-9

Please indicate on the permission letter your preferred arrangements for collecting your child when prom finishes at 9.30pm.
