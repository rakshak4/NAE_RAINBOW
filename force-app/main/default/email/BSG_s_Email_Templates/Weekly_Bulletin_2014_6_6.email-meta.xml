Bulletin – Week Beginning Monday, 9th June 2014


Dear Parents,



Parents Meeting:

I would like to thank parents who attended the information sessions this Wednesday. It was an opportunity to share our plans for the new school year and update you on a number of important issues. I appreciate the comments and feedback received during the sessions and we value input from our parent community in helping to make positive changes to our school.



Parent Support Groups: Please note that we would like volunteers for parent support groups next year. We intend to have parent 3 groups operating next year to further build links within our community and to give parents an opportunity to have an input into the secondary section of the school.



Fund-raising and events committee:

A Similar role to the current EFC:

· Helping with fund-raising initiatives;

· Support international day;

· Support Secondary school social events.



Careers:

To assist our careers programme by offering the following;

· Student interview practice;

· Work experience placements;

· Running a stall at our Careers fair;

· Giving short talks to our students.



Steering committee:

· To give feedback on school initiatives

· To offer suggestions as to the future direction of the school

· To represent sub-sections of our community and to give our parents a say in how the school is run.



Please contact Mr. Iain Ruck (iain.ruck@bsg.org.cn) if you are interested in volunteering to support either group. We will have a recruitment drive at the start of next academic year and the aim will be to have 3 functioning groups supporting different elements of the school.



Council of International Schools (CIS) Visit:

Next week we have CIS inspectors coming into the school to complete the second part of the accreditation process. The inspectors will meet with Parents, students, academic staff, administrative staff as well as the senior leadership and governors of the school. They will be in for 4 days and we are looking forward to showing them our secondary school.



Music Festival:

On Friday, 13th June students from Year 7-10 will be enjoying the BSG music festival. This has been organized by a number of our Year 9 students, Kate, Sarah, Reece, Haerin, Nae Young, Charlene, Jackson, Sum Yi and Alesandra, and it is very gratifying to see our students stepping up and taking responsibility for such a venture.



Residential Trips:

We have an exciting few weeks ahead with Junior Prom taking place this Friday and students beginning to plan their end of year residential trips. Students will be receiving important letters regarding their trips in particular the kit they will need and also the departure times. Please do read these thoroughly and do not hesitate to contact tutors if you have any questions about the arrangements.



ASAs:

Please be reminded that we have now finished the ASA programme for the school year and will therefore be finishing at 3pm for the remainder of term.
