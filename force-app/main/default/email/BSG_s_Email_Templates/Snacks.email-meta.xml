Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We encourage our students to bring healthy snacks to school to be eaten during break times. I would like to ask all parents to support us in this initiative and avoid chocolate bars. Since we have a number of children with severe peanut allergies in school we also insist that snacks with peanuts are not consumed in school. Please check wrappers carefully to ensure you do not inadvertently send in snacks which contain peanuts.

Many thanks,

Mark Thomas
Headmaster
The British School of Guangzhou
