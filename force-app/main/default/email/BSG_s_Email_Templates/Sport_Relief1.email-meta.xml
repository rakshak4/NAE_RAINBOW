    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

On Saturday 17th March, the British Consulate will be hosting a Sport Relief/ Comic Relief event to raise funds for people living incredibly tough lives, both in the UK and across the world&apos;s poorest countries.


We are pleased to announce that The British School of Guangzhou will be an official sponsor of this event and to help raise funds we will be having a Non- Uniform Day for all Secondary students on Friday 2nd March. In order to help us make a substantial donation, please send students to school on Friday 2nd March dressed in red clothes with a donation in a sealed envelope. If you would like to attend the Sport Relief event on Saturday 17th March please see the attached flier.


You can find more information about this event at http://www.sportrelief.com/ .


Thank you very much for your support and we will be in touch soon with regards to more fundraising events.  Please do check our school website for charity updates and photos.



Kind regards,



Administration Team
