Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

The British School of Guangzhou is holding a day of fun for families from the international community on Saturday, 10th November 2012.

The event will be organised by the EFC (The Events and Fundraising Committee), the school’s parent volunteer association, and is expected to attract a large number of families from the school and the greater international community. It is one of the major social days in the school calendar with over 1300 people attending this event last year.

International Day event is an enjoyable way to learn about different countries and their culture with activities, stalls, vendors, games and much more for families to enjoy. All proceeds collected will go directly to the EFC and the school’s nominated charity.

One of the main attractions of the event will be a ‘Prize Draw Raffle’ held on the main stage. As we prepare for the event, we would like to inform you that the EFC is currently taking donations for prizes from individuals, companies and organisations. This is a great way for our supporters to raise their profile within the greater International community while helping the school and supporting various Charities. Last year EFC fundraising contributed towards Charities such as ActionAid!, Thai Flood Relief and Coleurs De Chine.
