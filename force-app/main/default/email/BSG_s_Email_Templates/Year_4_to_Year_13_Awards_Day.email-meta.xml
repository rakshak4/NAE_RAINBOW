Dear Parents,


I am pleased to inform you that the British School of Guangzhou will be holding their Annual Awards Day at the Sofitel Hotel Guangzhou, Friday 27th June. This is the final day of the term and we hope that it will provide a memorable end to an exciting year. During the morning, children from Year 4 upwards will receive awards and we would like to invite all parents to join us in celebrating achievements from the school year.


The event will begin at 9:30am with tea and coffee available in the foyer outside the function room. Presentations will start at 10am and the programme will include performances from the choir. The event will conclude with a group photograph of all award winners on the stage at approximately 11:30am.


As this is a formal occasion, children should wear full school uniform, including blazers and long trousers for boys.


There will be no bus service for students on this day therefore we request that parents and children travel together to and from the event. Please note those students who are receiving an award will sit with the academic staff at the front of the ballroom.


I sincerely hope that all of our families will be able to attend on this special day.



Regards,


Mark Thomas


Headmaster
