Dear Parents,



Welcome to the latest edition of the BSG Newsletter.



As promised, we have special coverage of Book Week and Secondary&apos;s Bugsy Malone performance.



Before we look to Lower School, we are excited to introduce the Global Classroom programme. This is a Nord Anglia Education initiative enabling students to develop skills online and collaborate with children worldwide.



Spring has well and truly sprung in Foundation and our diets dissected by our very own Miss. Choco Chomps and Captain Vegetable! We also look at ASAs and the decorative doors of distinction from Book Week.



On Upper School, Year 2&apos;s camp out proved to be a fantastic success with Mr. Will&apos;s ghost games and bonfire bedtime stories. Year 3 &apos;rock&apos; it up and we have two superbly written stories from Year 4 students. Year 5 and 6 had leading roles during Book Week and we have an excellent update followed by a 4-page picture extravaganza!



In Secondary, we are delighted to announce the offer of a UK scholarship to another pupil and our Sixth Form Psychology students observe the little ones at Lakefront. We also have a follow-up from the IA Bronze Award adventure and photos of Bugsy Malone.



As we edge towards the end of the academic year, we reflect on our cohort of A-Level students who are the first to leave and go on to university in July. In a special report, our Year 13s give us their words on studying at BSG and their hopes for the future.

We hope you enjoy this issue and look forward to the next.



Kind regards,
