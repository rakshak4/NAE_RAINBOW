Bulletin – Week Beginning Monday, 2nd June 2014


Dear Parents,



Dragon Boat Holiday (Monday 2nd June)

We will be closed this Monday for the dragon boat holiday. I am sure that our students will appreciate the long weekend coming at the end of their examination week.



ASAs

We have now finished the ASA programme for the school year and therefore will be finishing at 3pm for the remainder of term.



Parent Information Meeting (Wednesday 4th June)- Years 7-10

On Wednesday we are holding information sessions for parents to discuss our plans for the new academic year (2014-2015) and address a range of school issues.

There will be two sessions are: 2.00pm-3.00pm or 6.30pm-7.30pm. Please inform your child’s form tutor if you plan to attend and indicate which session.



Year 8 form group (2014-15) changes:

Year 7 received a letter that outlined form group changes for next academic year. Students will be asked to return these forms to their form tutors and their preferences will be taken into account when the groups are created. The changes have been made as we will be moving to 3 form entry in Year 8.



Key Stage 3 Language Options – Years 7-8

Students have received an important letter regarding their language options for next year. After careful consideration we will be making a number of changes to our programme, outlined in the letter, which I will address in the parent information sessions on Wednesday 4th June. Students should make their language selection after discussing the options with their parents and teachers and return to school by Friday, 6th June.



Junior Prom (Friday 6th June) – Years 7-9

The moment our Key Stage 3 students have been waiting for has arrived- Junior Prom. The event will be held from 6.30pm this coming Friday and I am very pleased to learn that most of our students will be attending. For those who will be leaving us at the end of term, it will be a great way to say goodbye to their friends.
