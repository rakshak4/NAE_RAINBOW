Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We have arranged for a representative from Hong Kong City University to visit the school and deliver a speech on their institution on Wednesday 10thOctober from 2.30-4pm. All of our Year 12 students will be attending and we would like to open the invitation to parents. Over the next few years there will be a number of university speakers visiting us here at school, so please do not worry if you can not attend this time. If you are interested in attending, please e-mail me at Nicholas.mckie@bsg.org.cn.
I have also attached a brochure outlining the upcoming sailing trip in Hong Kong. Students will be receiving medical forms to fill in and return by the end of this week.
For more information on future university speakers and upcoming events in the sixth form, please refer to the school website, www.bsg.org.cn, under ‘school news’.
