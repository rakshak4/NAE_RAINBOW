Bulletin – Monday, 30th June 2014



Dear Parents,



Another year at BSG comes to an end and the time has arrived when we must say a fond farewell to families and teachers who leave us for pastures new. I know that many tears have already been shed during residential trips as students said goodbye to one another at airport and I am sure there were many more during this Friday’s Speech Day.



Speech day: Many thanks to all those families that attended this year’s speech day. It is an honour to be able to celebrate the successes of our students over the course of this year and I attached a list of winning students below.



Speech day award winners: Please click here.



I would also like to make a special thank you to Marc Santos and Kelly Wong for doing an excellent job as the Master of Ceremonies for this event as well as to Carol Ye who gave a thought provoking speech about lessons that she learnt at BSG. Finally, we were also treated to a superb performance from the choir, a Piano Trio and powerful reflections on the recent residential trip to Europe.



I wish all of our departing students good luck in their new schools, thank them for the contribution that they have made and I hope they will take fond memories of BSG wherever they go.



Reflections of the year:

We have had an incredibly busy year again with a number of highlights that I would like to mention in this review.



Graduating Year group: It will be with mixed feelings that we say goodbye to our Year 13 students who will be leaving for University in September/October. It is with a sense of pride that we see the prestigious universities that they have been given offers for but it is always sad to lose people from our community.



Nord Anglia membership: We have become a member of a larger educational organization. There will be a number of positive initiatives that are now open to us and we look forward to our students joining the Global classroom (A network connecting the students of the 28 schools in Nord Anglia) and a possible field trip to Tanzania.



Student leadership: I have been personally delighted by the way this has developed over the course of this year. We believe that when students are given the opportunity to lead they are able to both show and learn much more about being a responsible person. The Key stage 3 students have had this through their House challenges and access to be Junior House captains, we have had a functional school council as well as a number of sporting, academic, charity and house leadership opportunities that a number of students have taken.



Charity initiatives: Under Ms. Boby’s direction the various Charity work that the school has done has increased in size and ambition. This has included a week’s visit in support of our Action aid course as well as our students supporting the learning of those with physical impairments through our support of GETCH.



Sports: We have competed in the FOBISIA games at both Under 13 and Under 15 games and in the Pearl river Conference. Our teams have enjoyed success in Basketball, Football, Volleyball and Touch Rugby as well as in individual activities such as swimming and Athletics.



The Arts: The School production was a stand out highlight of the year with stunning performances from the cast ably supported by the stage crew and the Musicians. As ever, the choir have acted as ambassadors for the school through their superb level of performance as well as the numbers in attendance and the school has been lit up by the number of Art projects and installations that Mr. Delmotte and Ms. Barrenechea have inspired the students to produce.



House/ASA: This programme has continued to grow and the student involvement and passion for this area has been superb. We are looking to develop the ASA programme again next year to have more obvious curriculum extension and support activities to assist those who need support and to challenge those with a passion for the subject.



Social Events: The two proms were fantastic this year with the students dressing up and the amount of work that the Pastoral team, with help from the students and other members of staff, did in creating and designing the “James Bond” and “The Oscars” themed sets was phenomenal. We will be hoping to build on the success of these social events next year.



Notices on staffing:



Leaving staff: It is equally sad time for staff as we say farewell to friends and colleagues and I’m certain that our students and families will also want to wish our leaving staff, Mr. &amp; Mrs. Ellis, Ms. Rowan, Mr. and Mrs. Burlingham, Ms. Liu, Mr. Furniss and Mr. Sumner, all the best for their next posts. I would like to thank our leaving staff in particular for their efforts during their years of service at the school. Also leaving are Ms. Smyth and Ms. Wutzke, who have substituted for Mrs. Grice-Glover this last term and have had a positive impact on school in such a short amount of time.



New staff: We are delighted to be able to welcome a number of new staff are the secondary phase continues to expand and develop. As ever, we have recruited staff with UK or UK curriculum experience and we are certain that they will add further experience and expertise to our existing team.
