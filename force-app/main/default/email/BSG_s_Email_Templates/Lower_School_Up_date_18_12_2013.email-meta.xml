Dear Lower School Parents,

As the term draws to an end and Christmas is nearly upon us I would like to take this opportunity to review the latter part of Term 1. As I reflect upon what has been a long and very busy term I feel extremely proud of our students, especially those that joined us this year and spent some time settling into life at BSG. Some of our students are only two years old when they join us and it is so pleasing to see them all now nicely settled and beginning their learning journey with us. I would also like to thank all parents, both existing and new, for being so supportive this term. I shall look forward to welcoming you all back in 2014.

Pre-Nursery, Nursery &amp; Reception Christmas Performances

Last week saw the wonderful Christmas performances from our Pre-Nursery, Nursery and Reception children. On both days the children sang beautifully and looked fantastic in their costumes. I would like to thank all the teachers and teaching assistants for their hard work and efforts in ensuring the performances were a success. I would also like to thank the parents who helped with the costumes and other aspects of the productions, I know your support was very much appreciated by the teachers.
Please note that Year 1 students will be planning their very own production in Term 3, which will give the children an opportunity to show off their creative skills and talents - one to look forward to!

Surprise Santa Visit

The children were delighted last week with a surprise visit from Santa. Whilst the children were busily working away Santa popped into each of the classrooms bringing gifts for everyone. It was an extremely busy morning for Santa as he also made an appearance at the Playgroup Christmas party. Santa said his goodbyes to the children and returned to the North Pole to prepare for Christmas.

100% Attendance

Attendance at school is an extremely important aspect of children’s education. We therefore like to celebrate those children who have achieved 100% attendance this term. On Friday special certificates will be awarded to those children who have come to school every day this term. A big thank you to the parents too as without your support this would not be possible.

Pantomime

Every year our talented teaching assistants across the whole school perform a pantomime for the students. This year the TAs are doing their version of &apos;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs’. The Lower School children will be going to the Upper School on Thursday morning to watch what promises to be a fantastic show.

Bake Sales

Our Lower School Bake Sales have been very successful so far this year raising nearly 4000RMB this term alone. The money raised from Bake Sales is split between the EFC and our chosen charity Action Aid. In 2014 we will be introducing ‘Cake Vouchers’ for all those children who bring goodies in to sell on the cake stall, this means that if you bake or buy something for the Bake Sale then your child will be given a ‘Cake Voucher’ and does not need to bring 5RMB to school to purchase something from the stall.

2014 Lower School Calendar

For the eagle-eyed people amongst us you may have noticed a slight mistake in the Lower School 2014 calendar. Instead of December 2014, the month is actually dated 2013. Luckily all the dates are correct it is just the year that is incorrect. I would like to apologise for this error, and fully understand if any parent would like a full refund of their money. I would also like to reassure you that I will ensure the 2015 calendar is in circulation by November 2014 to enable parents to purchase the next calendar ready to use in December. I would also like to point out that I will be having strong words with our printing company!

Last Day of Term

The last day of term is Friday 20th December. The children will be having a ‘Cinema Experience’ in the Hall on this day. Children are also invited to come to school in party clothes. Please note that school will finish at 12:00pm on Friday.

Well, all that is left to say is to wish you all a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. I shall look forward to welcoming everyone back to school on Monday 6th January 2014.

Best wishes for the festive season,

Miss Kathy
