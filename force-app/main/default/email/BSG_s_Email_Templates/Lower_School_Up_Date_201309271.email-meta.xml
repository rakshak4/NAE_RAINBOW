Dear Parents,


The BSG Charity Committee and ICT students are collaborating together to run a ‘Bring &amp; Buy’ stall selling secondhand computer equipment at the forthcoming International Day 2013 to be held Saturday, 9th November. All proceeds raised will be donated to our chosen charity, Action Aid. Any unsold computer equipment on the day will be donated to a charity which reconditions computers and allocates them to disadvantaged students in schools in China.


We would appreciate your support in this fundraising drive, by supplying us with any old or unwanted electronic equipment that is in working order. Examples could include:


Mobile Phones
E-readers (e.g. Kindles…)
Tablets (e.g. iPads…)
Laptops and MacBooks
Desktops
MP3 Players
Game Consoles (e.g. Xbox, PlayStations…)
Handheld Game Consoles (e.g. PSPs, Nintendo DS…)
Cameras
Peripherals (e.g. monitors, mouse, keyboard, USB sticks, speakers, printers, scanners, routers, modems…)


Please kindly note all electronic equipment should have personal data removed and password locks deactivated.


Please ask students to bring the electronics into school before Friday, 8th November to leave with Miss. Fish in the Secondary ICT Suite. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact Miss Fish through debra.fish@bsg.org.cn


Thank you in advance for your help with this campaign.


Yours Sincerely,


Miss D Fish

Head of ICT

The British School of Guangzhou
