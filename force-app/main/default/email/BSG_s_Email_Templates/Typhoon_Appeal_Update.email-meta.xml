Dear Parents,


On behalf of BSG community I would like to say a massive thank you for supporting the Typhoon Appeal organised by Miss Dunningham and the Charity Committee at the end of November. With your support we were able to raise 22964 RMB through events within the school including auctions, music events and also a non-uniform day. The money raised has gone to Save the Childrenâ€™s relief fund (www.savethechildren.org/site/c.8rKLIXMGIpI4E/b.6150549/). We were also able to send items of need such as bedding and clothing.


A further report from the days events will be published in an upcoming Urban Family article.


Regards,


Amanda Boby
