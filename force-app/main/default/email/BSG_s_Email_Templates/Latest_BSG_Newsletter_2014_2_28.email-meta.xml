Dear Parents,


Welcome to the latest BSG newsletter!



In this edition, we take a look at all the events and activities from Chinese New Year, which include the ever-popular dragon dances.



As well as coverage of all the cultural fun, we have updates from each phase, with Minecraft Maths, cat caper newspapers, inter-house challenges and a report on our first successful Careers Fair.



We hope you enjoy this edition.
