Dear Parents,



The latest BSG newsletter is available online covering all events and activities from Christmas to Chinese New Year.



Lower School had a festive few weeks with carol singing and a thrilling visit from Santa. We include a glance at some English superstars while Year 1 went out of this world to learn about space. Also, we have an overview of the EAL programme.



In Primary, Year 2 prepared for the new year and there was fruit-picking for Year 3. Year 4 is packed with rewards and recycling while Year 5 dug-up Roman artefacts. In Year 6, we look at our outstanding readers book club, enriching our top readers.



In Secondary, students enjoyed many Christmas activities as they were tasked with carol competitions and the KS3 challenge, plus a disco! We have an update from our Year 12 Habitat for Humanity trip and we meet the new Learning Representatives who will be supporting students by working with the teachers.



Following a music update, we finish with our photo pages covering all the Choir performances.



I hope you enjoy this edition as we look forward to the Chinese New Year Special in March!



Kind regards,




Stuart Geraghty
