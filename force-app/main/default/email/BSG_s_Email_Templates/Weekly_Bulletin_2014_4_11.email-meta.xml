Bulletin – Week Beginning Monday 14th April 2014


Dear Parents,


Our IGCSE and A level students are building up to their examinations and taking the opportunities offered by attending Revision programmes. We are also running 1-2-1 support initiatives, and have been for the past few months, and we intend to continue to use the remaining time left with our students to resolve any questions or doubts they may have. Please note that examination leave for Year 11 and 12 students starts from Monday, May 5th 2014.



Reports:

Students from Years 9-13 will receive their third report (Grade) of the year on Friday, 18th April 2014. Year 7 and 8 students will receive their full, written report on April 25th prior to their PTC that is scheduled for Monday, April 29th 2014.



ASAs to resume

After school activities will be resuming this week and buses will be departing at the usual time of 4pm. All students should have completed their choices and will be looking forward to the resumption of activities.

Junior and Senior Prom

We are planning on holding a prom for junior and senior students to celebrate the end of another great year at BSG. The Senior Prom (Years 10-13) will be taking place at the W hotel at the end of April and students can expect to dress to impress for the James Bond themed event.



We are also running a Junior Prom (Years 7-9) for the first time on Friday 6th June. A junior student committee is currently busy planning this event and details will follow in the next few weeks.



We would like to give our students a memorable yet affordable prom and are currently raising funds to help pay costs towards them. If you know of anyone who would be willing to sponsor both or one of these events then please contact either Miss Welch (Nicola.welch@bsg.org.cn) or Mr Ellis (Robert.ellis@bsg.org.cn) who will be happy to send through more information.



Best wishes,



Mr. Iain Ruck,

Head of Secondary
