Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Due to unforeseen circumstances Lakefront Management are unable to allow large buses to enter the Lakefront compound by the usual entrance.

Therefore, from Monday 10th September, the larger buses, will enter Lakefront by a new access road leading to the back of the Lakefront compound. Once there they will be transferred to a smaller shuttle bus and taken directly to the usual drop off point by the school gates. We will endeavour to ensure that any disruption to your child&apos;s journey is minimal and that at this point we are not expecting any changes to bus pick-up or drop-off times.

For those children who come to school on one of our small buses, the service will run as normal.

If you have any questions regarding this change please do not hesitate to contact me at katherine.weir@bsg.org.cn

Thank you for your continued support.

Kind regards,

Miss Kathy
