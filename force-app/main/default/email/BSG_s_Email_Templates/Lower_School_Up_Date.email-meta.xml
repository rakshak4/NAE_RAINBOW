Dear Lower School Parents,

I am pleased to inform you that the first two weeks of the academic year have been extremely successful with most children now settled into their new class and becoming familiar with their daily routine. I have been very impressed with the way in which the teaching staff have made the children feel so welcome and safe in their new environment and the way in which the older students have taken extra care of our younger students. It is always lovely to see the Year 1 students helping our younger, newer students adjust to their new school - testament to the caring attitude we encourage in all our students.

After School Activities (ASAs):

Our ASA programme will begin next week with school finishing at 4:00pm on both Tuesday and Thursday. We have a wide range of age specific ASAs to offer our students this year ranging from:

Nursery - Fun with Colours, Counting Club, Climbing Club, Puzzle Club, Fine Motor Skills, Ball Games, ICT, and Construction Club.

Reception and Year 1 -  Gymnastics, Library Club, Eco Club, Dance Club, Nature Club, Olympics, Construction and Play Dough Club.

In addition to the above we also have Ballet and Kung Fu classes.

The children are grouped in their house teams for our ASA programme and they are rotated throughout the year to ensure all children participate in all the ASAs at some point during the year. If you do not wish your child to take part in our ASA programme please make arrangements to collect them on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 3:00pm.

School Car Park:

I would like to remind parents of those children who are dropped off at school or collected at the end of the day how important it is for you to park your car in the car park above school rather than stopping or parking on the road outside of school. Lakefront management have quite rightly insisted that we do not allow cars to stop or park on the road and for the safety of all our students we must insist that you use the car park. When using the car park please abide by the traffic signs and turn your lights on when entering the car park. Please do not park anywhere that may obstruct other drivers and most importantly, please drive carefully.

Security Cards:

I would like to take this opportunity to remind parents that when collecting your child from school you must present your &apos;collected security card&apos; to the member of staff on duty. Please also ensure that if someone else is collecting your child that they also have a security card. Failure to do so will result in us not allowing your child to be handed over. If you loose your security cards please contact Miss Patience at patience@bsg.org.cn who will provide you with replacement cards.

New Kindergarten:

Thursday saw the grand  opening of the colourful new kindergarten opposite our school of which I was lucky enough to attend. We have formed a very good relationship with the management of the new kindergarten and I am pleased to inform you that we will continue to have full use of the football field at the times we need it. I would also like to inform you that to ensure our security levels are upheld we will be installing security fences and gates to ensure security is not compromised between the two schools. I shall look forward to working alongside the new school and developing a positive and mutually beneficial working relationship with them.

Happy Feet Football Programme:

I am pleased to announce that the Happy Feet Football Programme will continue this term. This is a great opportunity to enhance your child&apos;s gross motor skills whilst having fun with their friends. Please note this programme is not exclusively for BSG families, therefore if you have any friends that would like to join in the fun please do forward this email to them. The Happy Feet Football Programme is for children aged 2 - 4 years old and takes place at our Lower School every Saturday morning. If you would like to register your child please send an email to:guangzhoufa@gmail.com

BSG Playgroup:

Our Playgroup is now into its sixth year and I am pleased to inform you that it will re-open on Friday 6th September at the usual time of 9:30-11:30am. If you have younger children or have friends with little ones please do come along to meet other families and enjoy the refreshments provided while your children use the wonderful facilities in our Activity Room. Please note that children joining Playgroup must have an international passport which should be brought along the first time they visit. May I also remind parents that we do not allow children to attend with an ayi so at least one parent must be present at all times.

Chinese Celebration:

On Wednesday 18th September, in celebration of the Mid-Autumn holiday, the children will be asked to come into school in Chinese costume. We will be having a special Chinese lunch and the children will be taking part in a variety of Chinese themed activities on this day. Please note this date and start preparing for your child&apos;s Chinese costume! School will be closed for the Mid-Autumn festival on Thursday 19th and Friday 20th September

School life in general:

As you can see from the above information we have a very busy life at school. In addition to the above the children in Reception and Year 1 will start their swimming module soon, we have a Splay Day planned, Bake Sales, House Events, Halloween Disco, International Day, Maths Festival and a spectacular Christmas performance to plan. To ensure you don&apos;t miss anything please check your child&apos;s communication book regularly.

I am looking forward to a very busy, but undoubtedly, an extremely enjoyable first term.

Kind regards,

Miss Kathy
