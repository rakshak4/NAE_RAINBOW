Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

I would like to take this opportunity to inform you of the events that will take place on the Lower School campus over the next few weeks.

Reports and Parent-Teacher Consultation Day

On Friday 8th March you will be receiving your child’s mid-year student report. We hope this gives you an overview of how your child has progressed during the second part of the school year.

On Monday 18th March Parent-Teacher Consultations will take place to discuss your child’s progress in greater depth. We will be dedicating the whole day to parent consultations. There will be no school for children on this day, but they are welcome to attend the consultation with you if need be.

Consultations will begin from 9:00am until 6:00pm. Please complete the form your child will bring home today to indicate your preferred time period during the day and return it to school by Wednesday 13th March. A note will be placed in your child’s communication book on Thursday 14th March to inform you of your confirmed appointment time with your child’s teacher.

Please note that Miss Lou (P.E.) and Miss Queenie (Music) will be available for drop in appointments on the Lower School. Miss Helen (Music) and our Chinese and EAL specialists will be available in the Gymnasium on the upper campus (Nanhu) throughout the day for ‘drop in’ appointments.

For non-English speaking parents you are asked to make your own arrangements to bring along a translator, as we do not have the manpower to provide such support.

Please also note that our coffee shop will be open throughout the day if you would like to relax with a fresh cup of tea or coffee and a snack.

Lower School Sports Day

On Wednesday 20th March we will be holding our annual Lower School Sports Day. Please send your child to school in their P.E. uniform and their house colour t-shirt on this day.

Pre-Nursery &amp; Nursery Sports Day – 9:00-10:30am
Reception &amp; Year 1 Sports Day – 1:00-2:30pm

We would like to invite you to come and cheer on the children in their house teams. Our sporting events will take place on the playground culminating with the all-important announcement of the 2012 Sports Day winning team!

Book Week

During the last week of term children will participate in our annual Book Week. There will be lots of activities taking place throughout the week which will revolve around our favourite books and Nursery Rhymes.

On Thursday 28th March please send your child to school in their sleepwear for a ‘Snuggle-up and Read’ event.

On Friday 29th March please send you child to school dressed as a character from a book. Please note that school finishes at 12:00pm on this day.
