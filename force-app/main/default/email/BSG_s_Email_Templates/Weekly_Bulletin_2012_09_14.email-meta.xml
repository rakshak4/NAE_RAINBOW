Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

At my recent meeting with the board of governors we looked in detail at the results of the parental survey which was completed at the end of last term. My thanks go to the 222 parents who took the time to complete the survey, it is very important that we receive parental feedback in order that we can take into account the opinions of our parents when deciding on the future direction of our school.

I am pleased to say that the majority of responses were incredibly supportive and complimentary of our school, of the teachers and the current educational initiatives. However within the replies a number of issues were mentioned repeatedly and I would like to take this moment to address them.

Security on the Nanhu site

A number of parents felt that security needed to be improved on the Nanhu site. As a result we are reviewing current practices and will soon be announcing improvements. While this may initially cause some inconvenience to visitors I know that you will agree that this is not an area where we can have afford to take chances. If you have concerns regarding security you are encouraged to contact Paul Corr (Head of Administration) directly and he will deal with them.

Increased numbers of ASA days

This issue was only raised by some of the parents of our upper school students and came about when we announced the increased number of ASA and house competitions. The majority of concerns were to do with the need to ensure a high quality ASA programme and the need to provide a homework option for those students struggling to meet homework commitments. Since these concerns were brought to our attention last term and I am pleased to say that we were able to address most of them when we planned our ASAs for this term. We have received lots of positive feedback this term from students and parents about the broader range and better quality of ASAs. While we feel that we still have some way to go we have certainly made progress. The weekly house competitions have been particularly well  received with students feeling a real sense of belonging to their houses that had been missing in previous years. We have already planned next term’s ASAs and are looking at ways to ensure parents are made fully aware of clubs well in advance. While I can say with some confidence that film clubs no longer feature as typical ASA’s I have to admit that next term will be difficult as this is typically the wettest time of the year. If you do have specific questions about the ASA’s or the house competitions do contact Heads of phase directly and they will put you in touch with the relevant members of staff.

Text Books

Text books were mentioned by a number of parents with many people asking if they could get a copy of textbooks to use for revision and independent study at home. For those parents of Primary or Early Years students it is important to note that we do not teach from a set textbook in the British School. Lessons are prepared, by our teachers, to match our students needs and while teachers may occasionally use an exercise from a text they often present it to students on the interactive whiteboards rather than directly using the books. In the Secondary school set text books are provided for some subjects particularly at IGCSE level and Mr. Ruck (Head of Secondary) will contact Secondary parents to ensure they are fully aware of the Secondary situation. This particular issue is one that will be addressed further during workshops or parental meetings by the relevant heads of phase.

Bullying

At BSG we are particularly proud of the supportive environment that exists within our school and of the friendly relationships between staff and students. This was something that was commented on repeatedly in your survey responses. However we did receive 2 responses amongst the 222 that talked about instances of bullying that the parents felt had not been resolved satisfactorily. I cannot stress enough that parents are encouraged to contact the relevant heads of school immediately in such cases. Potential incidents of bullying should be dealt with immediately to ensure that the students and staff can continue to benefit from such an impressive learning environment.

The parental surveys will be sent out again this year with a number of additional questions, once again we would like to thank you for taking the time to give us such valuable and constructive feedback.
