Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Due to the adjudicator from the Xinghai Conservatory being unable to attend on Wednesday evening, we have now moved this event to Friday afternoon.

If you would like to come and watch, the event will take place in the theatre between 2-3pm on Friday 7th June.  Five of our talented young pianists have been selected from the audition stages to perform for the Professor Piano Studies (Xinghai Conservatory) for the prestigious title, &quot;BSG Pianist of the Year 2013.

Thank you as always for your support,

Kind Regards,

Ms Naomi Rowan

Head of Secondary Music and Performing Arts

The British School of Guangzhou
World Class Education
