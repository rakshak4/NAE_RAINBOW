IMPORTANT INFORMATION!

Lower School Closed - Wednesday, 18th June 2014


Dear Lower School Parents,


Due to a burst water pipe, the air conditioning system on our the Lower School campus (Lakefront) is currently out of order and was shut down by building management at 14:35 today.


We are working closely with Lakefront’s building management to rectify this situation but as we can not guarantee the school will have air conditioning systems working tomorrow, we have taken the decision to close the school for one day to assess damage and hopefully fix the problem.


We apologise for any inconvenience caused but am sure you will understand, we must put the health, safety and well being of the children as a priority so feel we have no choice but to close the school for at least one day.


Thank you for your understanding and we will keep you fully informed of the situation as we better understand the problem and available solutions.


Kind Regards,


Miss Kathy

Head of Lower School




The British School of Guangzhou
