Dear Parents,
 
It has been noted that when children are dropped off at the Lakefront campus in the morning some parents/drivers are either parking the cars at the end of the drive and walking the children into school or trying to drive up the driveway to the gate.
 
Both of these actions raise serious safety issues for the children and we must ask all parents/drivers arriving at school in the morning to use the car park upstairs or to park their car away from the entrance of the driveway. We have two cones positioned where the buses have to park to allow children to disembark from the buses in a safe manner. On several occasions cars have parked in front of these cones and despite being asked by the security guards to move the cars, they have not done so. This results in buses not being able to park in the designated safe spot for children to disembark the bus and children are ultimately sitting on buses unnecessarily.
 
Please be considerate of all our childrenâ€™s safety  needs and use the car park to drop your child off at school in the morning.
 
Thank you for your understanding and support with this.
