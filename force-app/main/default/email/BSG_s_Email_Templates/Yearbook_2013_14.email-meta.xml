Dear Parents,


We will soon be releasing the BSG Yearbook 2013/14.


Every family will receive a free digital copy on CD and we can announce that this will also include a special 18-track album of Secondary music!


The music is a mixture of singing and instrumentals covering some of the most popular performances of the year, including piano compositions, ensembles and vocals.


Enjoy!
