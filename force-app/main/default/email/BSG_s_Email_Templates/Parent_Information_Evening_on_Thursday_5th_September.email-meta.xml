Dear Parents,

&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;

I am pleased to announce that all students in Years 4, 5 and 6 will be able to receive their iPad Mini from Friday 6th September.


The device will be used extensively as a teaching and learning tool both in school and at home.


In order to receive the iPad mini, you must sign the &apos;Tablet Loan Agreement&apos; form and return it to school by Friday.


We understand that if you are new to the iPad Mini scheme you may have a lot of questions to ask.


We will be holding a parent information evening on Thursday 5th September at 6:00pm in the school theatre.


I would encourage you to attend, as there will be useful information presented. It is also the perfect opportunity to raise any questions you may have about the project.


If your child has already received an iPad as part of last year&apos;s pilot, there is no need to attend the information evening.


If you have any questions or queries please contact me at david.laird@bsg.org.cn


I look forward to seeing you on Thursday.


Kind Regards,


David Laird

Head of Primary

The British School of Guangzhou
