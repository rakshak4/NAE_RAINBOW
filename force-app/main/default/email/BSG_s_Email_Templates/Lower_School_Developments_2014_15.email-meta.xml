Dear Lower School Parents,
As we near the end of the school year I would like to take this opportunity to provide you with some information about planned developments for the Lower School for the forthcoming academic year.
Next year our Year 1 and Year 2 students will be moving to the new KS1 building on our Nanhu campus. This means that all current Reception and Year 1 children will be together in a brand new purpose built site catering specifically for five to seven year old students.
Whilst we will be sorry to lose Year 1 classes from the Lower School, it does allow us the opportunity to make changes to the Lower School to ensure we provide enhanced facilities for the youngest of our students - Pre-Nursery, Nursery and Reception.
Pre-Nursey

As we will have more classroom space next year we are going to open a third Pre-Nursery class. This year we have had a maximum number of 20 students per Pre-Nursery class. Next year we will reduce this maximum number to 16. There will be a lead teacher, two teaching assistants and two ayis per class. Our Pre-Nursery students will continue to leave school at 12:00pm.
Nursery

We will continue to have four Nursery classes next year. However, we will be moving the two smaller Nursery classes into larger classrooms to ensure they are provided with the most enabling environments. Each Nursery class will have a maximum number of twenty students.
Reception

Due to popular demand we will be increasing Reception to five classes next year. In some of the smaller classrooms we are installing a sliding wall between two rooms and turning them into larger classrooms. In addition to this, those classrooms that do not currently have direct access to the playground, new external doors will be fitted. Each Reception class will continue to have a maximum number of twenty students.
School Day - ASAs

With the Year 1 students moving on, this gives us the perfect opportunity to become a more Early Years specific campus and fall in line with Early Years recommendations from the UK. Based on some of the recommendations we have decided to discontinue the ASA programme for our Nursery and Reception students next year. The extended day is particularly challenging for our youngest children and to enable us to get the best out of them during the day it is important that they arrive home at a reasonable hour. Therefore, from August 2014 the school day for Nursery and Reception children will finish at 3:00pm throughout the year.
Enabling Environments - EFC Support

One of the most important principles in the UK Early Years Foundation Stage Framework is to provide young students with an enabling environment. We aim to offer stimulating and relevant resources, rich learning opportunities through play and playful teaching and offer support for children to take risks and explore. Next year we are planning many changes to increase the opportunities of learning activities we offer the students. As the EFC (Events and Fund Raising Committee) draws to an end in preparation of the newly formed PSGs (Parent Support Groups) to start next academic year, the EFC were keen to show their gratitude for all the support the Lower School has given them over the past few years. I am delighted to inform you that the EFC have kindly donated a large sum of money to the Lower School which will be able to support some of the following developments:

Role-Play Development - Each classroom will be provided with a role-play structure that the children will use their imaginations to create some wonderful role play areas. This will be perfect for developing creativity, imagination and language development!
Outdoor Learning Environment - We plan to transform our outdoor area with a whole host of exciting and stimulating resources and activities to encourage children to explore and investigate during their time outside.
Literacy Dedicated Room - As we will have a few spare classrooms next year, and with a focus on increasing Literacy standards, we are dedicating one of our classrooms to early literacy skills including speech and language acquisition and development, early reading and writing skills.
Learning Lounge - This will be a multi-purpose room in which a variety of learning opportunities will be set up. This will be a space where small groups of children can go with an adult for intervention teaching and learning.
Expansion to the Library - Many of the books in our library are Year 1 appropriate books and will therefore leave us along with the Year 1 students. On a brighter note, we have been approved to spend a considerable amount of money replacing books with even more exciting, age-appropriate books resulting in a much more Early Years friendly library.
Security

Next year the Lower School campus will be introducing a security card system to increase levels of security. more information regarding the implementation of this system will be released in  August.
As you can see we have some very exciting developments for next year, but before we get too carried away with our plans for August we must remember that as with every year, there are many events taking place in the final few weeks of school. These will all be communicated to you very soon in greater detail. In the meantime please note the following dates for your diary:

I hope you find the above information helpful. If you require any further information please do not hesitate to contact your childâ€™s class teacher. I will be absent from school the week commencing 2nd June as I am attending a Nord Anglia Education Senior Leadership conference at Warwick University in the UK. During my absence Mr. Gavin will be in charge with the support of our Year Leaders Miss Sophie and Ms Helen. I shall look forward to my return!
