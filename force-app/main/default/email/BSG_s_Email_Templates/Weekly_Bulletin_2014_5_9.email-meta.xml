Bulletin – Week Beginning Monday, 12th May 2014


Dear Parents,



Junior Prom- Years 7-9

Tickets are now available for Junior Prom that will take place at BSG on Friday 6th June, between 6.30pm-9.30pm. Our student representatives are currently finalising their plans to make a memorable evening for all concerned. The student planning committee has decided, in consultation with the student body, that the dress code for the event is strictly formal. This means that casual clothes or trainers will not be permitted. Tickets cost 50RMB and include entrance, a buffet and a bus at the end of the night to Citic Plaza to assist the picking up arrangements at the end of the night for those families that live in town.



Basketball fixtures:

Good luck to all of our teams in the PRC basketball tournaments this weekend. They have been training well at lunchtimes and during the ASAs sessions and we hope that this is reflected in their performances.



International Art Fair (Art Basel) Hong Kong - Fri 16th &amp; Sat 17th May

Year 9-13 Art will be attending the Art Basel Fair in Hong Kong next weekend. This renowned visual arts fairs will include a number of works by world famous artists as well as those by exciting new talent. The event is expected to attract many visitors; last year’s fair saw over 60,000 people attend. I am sure the students (and teachers) will have a great trip.



Advanced Notice: Years 7-9 Exam Week - Mon 26th May- Fri 30th May

At the end of this month, students in Years 7-9 will be sitting exams in each of their subjects. The purpose is to examine what students have learned this year and identify any areas of weakness to improve before the next school year begins. Subject teachers will provide guidance as to how best prepare for the exams however students are expected to do the majority of revision at home. Please note that Chinese examinations will take place the week afterwards.
