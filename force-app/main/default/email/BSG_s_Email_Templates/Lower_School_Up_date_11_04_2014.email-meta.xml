Dear Parents,
Welcome to our final term of this academic year. I hope you all had an enjoyable holiday, despite the wet weather here in Guangzhou! I am pleased to inform you that the children have settled back into school very well this week and appear eager for yet another busy term. Please note the following information. If you require any further details, please do not hesitate to contact your child’s class teacher.
Summer Uniform
As the warmer weather is finally with us, children should now wear their summer uniform to school. If you require any uniform items please contact our uniform officer at rainbow@bsg.org.cn
Lakefront Gatehouse
Due to the wet weather we have experienced recently the completion of the new Lakefront Gatehouse has been delayed. We are hoping very much that within the next week or so the new Gatehouse will be open for normal use.
Report Feedback
I would like to thank those parents who completed the report feedback slips for Term 2. A total of 68% parents returned the forms with the following results:

47.8% - Very Good
45% - Good
7.1% - Satisfactory
0% - Disappointing

Parental feedback is extremely important to us and I am pleased to note such a high percentage of positive comments received. Suggested changes made by parents are currently being considered and appropriate changes will be made to continually improve our reporting system.
Curriculum Up-dates
Today your child will be bringing a Curriculum Up-date Booklet home with them. The aim of this booklet is to provide you with information about what the children will be learning about in their year group this term. All classes will be going on a school trip this term to complement their curriculum. Further details about the trips will follow nearer the time.
Reading Workshop
I would like to remind you of the Parent Reading Workshop that will take place on Wednesday 16th April in the Lower School Hall between 3:00-4:00pm. We will be providing supervision in the Activity Room if you wish your child to stay at school whilst you attend the workshop. Important: If your child usually takes the bus home, but will be staying at school on this day, please ensure you inform the bus monitor otherwise your child will take the bus as per normal. If you plan to join us for the workshop kindly use G Block car park. Please do not park cars on the road or in reserved spaces in the car parks. Thank you in advance for your cooperation with this.
Parent Volunteers
I would like to take this opportunity to thank all those parents that have been coming into school over the past few months, both supporting and enhancing the reading programme within year groups. The staff are very appreciative of this support and the professional manner in which parents treat this level of school participation. If you currently do not come into school, but would like to do so, please contact your child’s class teacher.
Sports Day
I am pleased to inform you that the Lower School Sports Day will take place on Wednesday 30th April. Pre-Nursery and Nursery events will take place in the morning between 9:00-10:30am. Reception and Year 1 events will take place in the afternoon between 1:00-2:30pm. I hope you will be able to join us for these fun and active events.
I hope the above information is helpful. If you require any further details please do not hesitate to contact your child’s class teacher.
Kind regards,
Miss Kathy
Head of Lower School
The British School of Guangzhou
