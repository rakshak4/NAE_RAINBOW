Dear Parents,
I would like to provide you with the following information for the last two weeks of term.
Book Week
Next week will be our annual Book Week. Further to previous information I would like to remind you of the main events taking place during the Lower School Book Week:
Thursday 20th March - Costume Day. Children are invited to come to school dressed as their favourite book character. We will be using this as a fund raising event, so please send children to school with a donation of 10RMB. All money raised will go to Action Aid.
Friday 21st March - ‘Snuggle-up-and-Read’. Children are invited to come to school dressed in their night wear for a relaxing day of reading stories with hot chocolate and marshmallows as a special treat!
All Week - If any parents would like to come into school to read their favourite story to the class please contact your child’s class teacher.
Bake Sale
Wednesday 19th March - It is the turn of the Year 1 Zebras and Elephants to provide the goodies for this month’s Bake Sale. If you would like your child to participate in our Bake Sale please send 5RMB to school on this day. Please note that the Zebras and Elephants children do not need to bring any money if they are contributing something delicious for the Bake Sale.
Parent-Teacher Consultation Day
Meetings with your child’s class teacher and teaching assistant to discuss your child’s progress will take place on Monday 24th March. Please note, there will be no school for children on this day but they are welcome to come to school with you for the appointment. Supervision will be provided in the new Activity Room until 4:00pm if they wish to play whilst you are meeting with the teacher.
Lakefront Gate House
Due to the poor weather we have been experiencing recently the completion of the new Gate House at Lakefront has been delayed. We have been informed that the main entrance to Lakefront will be opening on 29th March. Please accept our apologies for any inconvenience caused.
Lakefront Car Park
This is a polite reminder to those of you who use the car par above school of the importance to abide by the car park regulations. Please drive slowly, turn your lights on when entering the car park, follow the one way system and only park in designated spaces. Please do not stop your vehicle on the road to allow passengers to disembark. Thank you for your cooperation with this.
Buses
Due to limited spaces on the school buses can we please ask that parents do not travel to or from school on the buses as this may result in a lack of seats for students. Thank you for your cooperation with this.
Parent Meeting
I would like to thank all those parents that were able to attend the Parent Meeting on Wednesday. It was very pleasing to see so many parents supporting such an event despite the weather. I hope you found the meeting useful and I shall look forward to working more closely with parents to further develop our school. Please note that a Parent Representative meeting will be planned during Term 3 in preparation for the new academic year.
Playgroup
BSG Playgroup takes place every Friday in the New Activity Room between 9:30-11:30am. If you have younger children please do come along to join us, or if you know of friends with young children please do feel free to invite them. It is free, all that we ask is that parents bring their child’s international passport with them the first time they visit.
Family Tea Parties
During the final week of term your class teacher will be inviting you to school for a Family Tea Party. Please check your child’s weekly curriculum up-date for dates and times.
Uniforms
At the beginning of Term 3 we would like to change from the winter uniform to the summer uniform. However, as the weather has been so unpredictable recently it is hard to predict what the weather will be like in April. The date for the change to summer uniform is Monday 7th April, however, if temperatures are still low at this time please feel free to send your child to school in their winter uniform. There will be further communication nearer the time with regards the official date for students to wear their summer uniforms. If you require any uniform items please contact our uniform officer at Rainbow@bsg.org.cn
Second Hand Uniform Sale
On Wednesday 26th, Thursday 27th and Friday 28th March there will be a Second Hand Uniform stall set up in the main Reception area of the Lower School. If you would like to purchase uniform items at a discounted price please do visit the stall. Furthermore, if you have any unwanted uniform items at home that are of a good quality and you would like to donate them to school please send them into school with your child before the above dates.
Last Day of Term 2
Friday 28th March will be the last day of Term 2. As a special treat the children and staff will be invited to come to school in non-uniform/casual clothes. Please note that school finishes at 12:00pm on this day.
Term 2 is nearing to an end and I would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your support this term and to especially thank the children and staff for all their hard work. I wish you all a pleasant holiday and look forward to welcoming the children back to school on Monday 7th
Kind regards,
Miss Kathy
Head of Lower School
The British School of Guangzhou
