Dear Primary Parents,


We are pleased to announce the introduction of &apos;Class Blogs&apos; for all Primary year groups. These class blogs will replace the old style &apos;Communication Books&apos; many of you will remember from last year.


What is a &apos;Class Blog&apos;?


The Class Blog is an on-line communication tool. It will be used to inform you of useful information that will help you to support your child&apos;s learning from home. Your child&apos;s teacher will update the class blogs on a daily or weekly basis.


What information will you receive through a class blog?

Weekly homework information
Curriculum letters
Class timetables
Class event reminder
PE Day and Swimming Day reminders
Photos, videos and pictures of student work (please note, if you do not want the blog to contain school content featuring your child, please email the class teacher directly.)

How do you access the class blog and how often should you look at it?


You should check the class blog daily. It will only take a few minutes. To access the class blog follow the links below.

Year 2: Bsgyear2.edublogs.org
Year 3: Bsgyear3.edublogs.org
Year 4: Bsgyear4.edublogs.org
Year 5: Bsgyear5.edublogs.org
Year 6: Bsgyear6.edublogs.org

From here all the information available will be displayed. It really is as easy as that! Note: a good tip to stay updated is to click on the word &apos;Follow&apos;, which you will find on the home page of the blog. You will be asked to fill in your email address. When this is complete, every time an item is added or updated on the blog, you will receive an email.

We are excited about the introduction of this useful and convenient way to communicate with parents and I&apos;m sure you will both enjoy and find these useful. If you have any questions or feedback about the introduction of class blogs or school communication in general, please feel free to contact me directly.
