Dear Parents,

I trust this email finds you very well.

At this time of the year outbreaks of Hand, Foot and Mouth disease are relatively common in China, and unfortunately we have had a couple of cases in our Lakefront campus. The school has already put into place the preventative measures listed and this will continue. All classrooms on our Lakefront campus will also be disinfected with both ultra-violet light and a disinfectant. 

Please find the attached letter for more information and should you have any questions please feel free to contact us.

kind regards,
