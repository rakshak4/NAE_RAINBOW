Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Hopefully you and your children are all ready and excited about the forthcoming residential trip. It should be an amazing week where the students try new and different activities and really get to know their peers, as well as their teachers.

On the morning of Monday 22ndof October, when we travel to Qingyuan, your child should come to school wearing their PE uniformand bring all the items on the kit list packed in the rucksack. We will set off from BSG at approximately 8:20am, therefore your child will be able to take the school bus to BSG as normal.

Once we arrive at the destination, a member of staff will contact the class rep who will then contact the first people on the telephone tree.

For updates and the daily progress of the students we have set up an online blog at the address below. You will be able to read all about our adventures as well as being able to leave messages for the students which we will pass on during the evenings.

The emergency contact for the Year 6 trip will be:

Mr Gary Hancock: 13724140985.

Please be aware that this contact number is only to be used in case of emergencies.

If your child requires any medicine during the trip, then please give this to your class teacher on the day of the trip. The medicine should be given in a clear plastic bag, with your childâ€™s name onas well as dosage instructions.

On Friday the 26th October, we are due to set off from Qingyuan at 11:00am. We estimate that our arrival time at BSGwill be approximately 2:00pm, therefore they should return before the end of school, and your child will return home on the school bus.If there are any changes in the return time due to delays, you will be informed via the telephone tree.

Finally, thanks to all that have completed the online registration. If you have not done this already, please do so byThursday 18th of October.

Regards,

David Laird
