Dear Parents,



As your school continues to grow, we have the pleasure to announce the creation of a brand new ‘Key Stage One’ building that is currently being developed to add to facilities on the Nanhu campus. Work on this building started just after Chinese New Year and is scheduled to finish at the end of July, ready for us to receive students at the start of next academic year (August 2014/15).



The building will overlook the current Adventure Playground, creating ten dedicated Year One &amp; Two classrooms, three exciting new specialist teaching areas, plus a PE &amp; Dining Hall for the exclusive use of Key Stage One students.



These extra facilities will further enhance our ability to support younger students within our Primary school, while also allowing other year groups within the school to benefit as our Key Stage One department comes together within this purpose built annex building.



Further updates to this and other developments planned at the school will be provided throughout the year but for now, please join us in welcoming these exciting improvements to your school.



Best wishes,



Mr. Mark Thomas

Principal




The British School of Guangzhou
