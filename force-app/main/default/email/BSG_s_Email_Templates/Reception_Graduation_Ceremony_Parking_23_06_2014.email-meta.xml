Dear Reception Parents,
If you are able to join us for tomorrow’s Reception Graduation Ceremony please note that once the car park above school is full, you will be directed to park in the G Block car park. Please can we also request that you do not park in any parking spaces that are reserved for residents.
Thank you for your support with this and we shall look forward to seeing you tomorrow.
Kind regards,
Miss Kathy
Head of Lower School
The British School of Guangzhou
