Dear Parents,

On Friday 15th November you will be receiving your child’s initial student report. We hope this gives you an overview of how your child has settled into school during the first part of the school year. The week after you have received your child’s report Parent/Teacher Consultations will take place to discuss your child’s progress in greater depth.

Due to the amount of positive feedback we received from parents regarding the decision to have parent consultations during the day rather than the evening, we are pleased to inform you that this term Parent/Teacher Consultations will again take place over a period of one day. This change is due to the fact that many families were unable to attend our usual consultations, which in the past were held in the evenings only.

Therefore, on Monday 18th November we will be dedicating the whole day to parent consultations. There will be no school for children on this day, but of course they are welcome to attend the consultation with you if need be.

Consultations will begin from 9:00am until 6:00pm. Please complete the form your child will bring home today to indicate your preferred time period during the day and return it to school by Wednesday 13th November. A note will be placed in your child’s communication book on Friday 15th November to inform you of your confirmed appointment time with your child’s teacher.

Please note that Miss Lou (P.E.) and Miss Queenie (Music) will be available on the Lower School if you wish to speak to them and all our Chinese and EAL specialists will be available in the Gymnasium on the upper campus (Nanhu) throughout the day for ‘drop in’ appointments.

For non-English speaking parents you are asked to make your own arrangements to bring along a translator, as we do not have the manpower to provide such support.

Please also note that our coffee shop will be open if you would like to relax with a fresh cup of tea or coffee and light refreshments will be provided throughout the day.

We look forward to seeing you all on this day!

Regards,

Miss Kathy
Head of Lower School
The British School of Guangzhou
