Dear Parents,

As the first half term draws to an end I am very pleased to report that all the children have settled beautifully into their new classes, they are enjoying the vibrant curriculum and the variety of other stimulating activities that have taken place during the first few weeks of term. I would like to take this opportunity to share with you some of the events that have taken place recently and some general school information.

School Closure due to Typhoon Warning

I would like to thank all parents for their understanding over the closure of school on Monday. Under instruction from the Education Bureau we closed the school for the safety of our children during Typhoon Usagi. As with all weather conditions it is very difficult to predict the actual outcome and fortunately by the time Typhoon Usagi had reached Guangzhou it had lost much of its force. However, reports show that other cities and towns were less fortunate and our thoughts are with the people of those places that were effected by the typhoon.

Reception &amp; Year 1 Splash Day and Swimming Programme

Friday 6th September saw a very wet day at the Lower School as Reception and Year 1 classes had their Splash Day. The football pitch was turned into a super splash zone in which everyone had fun in and out of the water. Observing from a distance (so as not to get wet) I had a difficult time deciding upon who was actually having more funâ€¦ the students or the teachers?

After the fun Splash Day the more serious side to swimming took place with the weekly swimming lessons. Swim safety is an extremely important part of a child&apos;s development and we were pleased to see so many children taking part in the swimming lessons and the amount of progress that has been made in such a short space of time. Weather pending swimming will continue for two weeks after the holiday. There will also be a further swimming module in term 3 for all Reception and Year 1 students. Pre-Nursery and Nursery students will also get the opportunity to have fun splash days in term 3.

Bake Sale

September saw our first Bake Sale of the year on the lower campus. It was the turn of the Year 1 Puffins and Bumble Bees to provide the cakes, cookies and other goodies and they did a fantastic job. All the children from Pre-Nursery up to Year 1 enjoyed a goodie from the Bake Sale and over 1,200RMB was raised for charity. I would like to thank all the parents who sent in cakes for this event, and a special thank you to the parents who came in to help on the stall on the day - much appreciated!

Mosquitoes

Due to our location we are constantly battling with the amount of mosquitoes on the school site. I would like to inform you that at present we have several methods of prevention in place such as electric mosquito catchers in classrooms, as well as vapour machines in classrooms, industrial mosquito catchers in shared areas, and we fumigate the school and surrounding area every other weekend to reduce the amount of mosquitoes around the school. We have also just placed a request to Lakefront management to remove all the foliage in the playground and replace it with lemongrass plants which are said to repel mosquitoes.

If your child particularly suffers from mosquito bites I strongly recommend you place mosquito repellant patches on your child&apos;s clothing and/or repellant spray on them in the mornings. You may also send repellant spray to school with your child and the class teacher or TA will help them to apply this at break times.

Pass Out Form

In an attempt to further improve our security systems we have introduced a &apos;Student Pass Out Form&apos;. If, for whatever reason, your child is collected from school between normal school hours your child&apos;s teacher or TA will need to sign a &apos;pass out&apos; form which the security guard will ask for at the gate before allowing your child to leave the premises. This is a very simple procedure that allows us to monitor the movement of students throughout the day and enables us to know which children have left the school premises in cases of an emergency evacuation. Your support with this procedure is appreciated.

Evacuation Practise

At BSG every term we conduct an evacuation practise to ensure all staff and students are fully aware of what they need to do in the event of an emergency evacuation. On Wednesday 25th September we had our first evacuation practise of the year and I am pleased to inform you it went incredibly well. Upon hearing the alarm all staff and students responded quickly and sensibly when leaving the school premises and walked safely to the evacuation point (Lakefront Tunnel). I would like to congratulate and thank students and staff for their efficient evacuation of the school building.

Hire of Activity Room

Many parents have been inquiring about the hire of the Activity Room and Coffee Shop for celebrating their child&apos;s birthday, so I thought it would be useful to give you some basic information with regards to party bookings. The Activity Room and Coffee Shop can be hired after school hours Monday to Friday (3:30-5:30pm) for 500RMB or during the weekends (9:00-1:00pm) and/or (2:00-6:00pm) for 1000RMB per session. The fee includes an ayi who is there to help set up, and clear away at the end of the party. The coffee shop is open for the purchasing of drinks, but you are also able to bring your own drinks and food for your guests. The room maybe decorated although we ask that nothing is stuck to the walls. If you would like further information about the hiring of the Activity Room and Coffee Shop please feel free to send me an email or pop in and see me at school.

Well, with a very busy first half term drawing to an end, all that leaves me to say is to wish you all a very happy holiday, and whatever you are doing please return safely on Monday 7th October refreshed and ready for the hectic run up to Christmas!

Best wishes,

Miss Kathy
