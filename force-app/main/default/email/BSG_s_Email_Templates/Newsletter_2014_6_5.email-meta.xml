Dear Parents,



Welcome to the latest BSG newsletter.



We are now fast approaching the end of the academic year and there&apos;s still so much going on throughout the school.



On Lower School, children have been exploring transportation, and if you enjoy walking, our fashionable Reception classes put on a designer shoe show! We also have some crazy comic capers from Year 1 and a glimpse into Nursery&apos;s personal and social development over the year.



On Upper School, we celebrate the very successful Maths Day with a look at all the activities that took place. Things became a mystery in Year 3 and Year 4 went bananas and bounced around various biomes and the botanical gardens. They were also taught a lesson by Key Stage 3 students!



Year 5 have been drumming up support for music and dance as they were visited by a Soul Djembe ensemble, while Year 6 went on a culinary revolution. We also have an inspirational student, some Dragon Boat Festival news and Viking house lunch photos.



In Secondary, Art took focus as students raised awareness of an important cause and also visited the Art Basel Fair in Hong Kong. We have full coverage of Maths Enrichment Week, the PRC Annual Basketball Competition and Enterprise Week, plus Year 10 got into the driving seat of business studies with a trip to Honda.



We hope you enjoy this edition.





Kind regards,



Stuart Geraghty
