    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

I have spoken to all of the trip leaders to report that the Year 7, 8 and 10 students have all arrived safely and on time. The Year 7&apos;s were on the beach doing surf exercises when I phoned and it sounded as if they were enjoying themselves. Year 8&apos;s had just arrived and had a bumpy flight whilst the Year 10&apos;s were causing havoc with their team building games.

The Year 9 students do not land until later and I will send an email out tomorrow to confirm their safe arrival as stated in the letter.

I&apos;m certain that the students will enjoy the trip and I look forward to hearing the stories and seeing the pictures on the blog (technology willing) and on the students return.

Best wishes,

Mr. Iain Ruck
