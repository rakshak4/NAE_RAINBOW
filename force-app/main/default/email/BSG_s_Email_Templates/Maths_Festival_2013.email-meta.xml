Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Weather permitting, the annual Secondary House Swimming Gala will take place at our Nanhu site on Tuesday, 25th June for all year 7 to 10 students. The Gala will begin at 08:30 after registration and finish around noon in time for the students to eat lunch as normal. Students will attend their last lesson of the day as normal. Please ensure that if your child is participating in the Gala that they come to school with swimming kit, towel and sunscreen. School uniform is not required on the day and students may travel to school in PE kit.

Parents are of course welcome to come and watch!


Kind Regards,

Alison Grice-Glover
Head of Secondary PE
