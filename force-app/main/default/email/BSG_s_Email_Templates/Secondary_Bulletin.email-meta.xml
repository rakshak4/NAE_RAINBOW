Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

I would like to wish you a very happy New Year and hope you had a relaxing Christmas break.

This week has seen our Yr. 12 students sitting their very first AS Level examinations in the Sciences and Maths. This is the start of their journey to University that will see them complete full A Levels next year. Our Yr. 11 students are also sitting their IGCSE mock examinations over the next 2 weeks in all subjects, in preparation for their full examinations in the summer term. We wish them all the very best of luck.

We would also like to remind parents about the procedures for absences. If your child is absent from school, can you please write a note in their diary explaining why they are absent. If there is no note the absence will remain unauthorised on our records.

The student council had their first meeting of the New Year this week and will continue to meet throughout the term. Forms or students who would like to raise issues with the council should be approaching their representative.

The ASA programme will be commencing next week with students having signed up online via the Secondary School Virtual Learning Environment.

Below is the schedule for next week:
