Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Music is an exciting and integral part of life at BSG, and to enhance this, we offer a full range of instrumental tuition. Instrumental lessons are available in drums, guitar, piano, flute, clarinet, brass, saxophone, cello, violin and voice.  Please note that that there will be a minimum number of students required to employ each member of the peripatetic team.

Please find more information via link1 and link2. Your child will also receive a hard copy of this letter through the register on Monday 27th August.

Please feel free to contact me at Naomi.rowan@bsg.org.cn if you have any questions.

Kind regards,

Naomi Rowan
Music Dept.
