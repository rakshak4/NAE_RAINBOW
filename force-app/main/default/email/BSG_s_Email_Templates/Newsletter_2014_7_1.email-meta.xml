Dear Parents,


Welcome to the final BSG newsletter of the 2013/14 academic year.


Lower School had a super Splash Day and a visit from a real life superhero! There were also swashbuckling pirates in Year 1 who went treasure hunting, and of course performed the fantastic production of Treasure Island!


In Primary, Year 3 have been doing some rock-hard research on minerals in Science while Year 4 became marketing gurus and Maths game gap fillers! Year 5 held their very own World Cup tournament and Year 6 said goodbye to Primary School.


As the end of the year is a time of reminiscing, we take a special look at the journeys of our EAL students and a report on the success of our Literacy Leaders and Learning Reps. It was also a brilliant end for our International Award cohort and for the first time at BSG, we congratulate the Year 13 graduates who are off to university!


There is also coverage of the Junior Prom as Hollywood glam fettered the corridors for the Key Stage 3 celebration.


Enjoy and see you at the start of 2014/15 for our Awards Day Special!
