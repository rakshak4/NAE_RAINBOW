Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Meet the Teacher

We’re looking forward to seeing you at the ‘Primary Meet the Teacher’ event tomorrow, 4:30pm. Due to the high numbers expected, we have decided to have a finger buffet instead of a barbecue. Please note this change from the original schedule.

Primary ASAs

Primary ASAs are due to get underway next week. We recently held our first ever ASA Fair. Students were treated to high quality displays ranging from various games and sports to arts and craft activities.

An ASA that has proved particularly popular is cooking. We need your help! If there are any cooks in the parent community, that would be willing to come into school and run a Thursday cooking club, please get in touch with us.  Your help would be very much appreciated.




Yours sincerely

David Laird
Head of Primary
The British School of Guangzhou
