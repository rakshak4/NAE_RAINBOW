Dear Parents,


As we get to the end of another very busy year I would like to wish all parents a safe and relaxing holiday. This has been our busiest and most productive year by far. It was a year that began with the news that we had become a member of the Nord Anglia Education group and ended with a preliminary visit from CIS, the Council of International Schools.


I am delighted to say that Nord Anglia Education have praised our school for the standards that your children are currently achieving and that CIS have also noted our achievements in their preliminary visit report. I would like to share with you some of the strengths that have been noted by the visiting CIS team and to thank everyone involved for their efforts.


Amongst the many positive features of our school noted by the CIS visiting team some of the most important are:




the change of ownership to Nord Anglia Education (NEA) has been very well received by the school community, the teaching staff, the administration, the parents and the support staff;

the change of ownership to Nord Anglia Education (NEA) has been well managed;

throughout that process of change, the schoolâ€™s leadership has been very successful in focusing on supporting staff to support students;

the support provided by NAE for HR, Finance, Administration, Governance, and for Teaching and Learning is focused on the needs of the students;

the school has shown an ongoing commitment to improve and develop the campus facilities for students;

the school has shown a commitment to the Professional Development of staff;

the relationships across the school are excellent: leading to a strong sense of family and community, for students, staff and parents;

the quality of the resources for learning, including technology for learning, is very good;

the quality of teaching is characterised by careful lesson planning, the use of rich and varied resources for learning, and positive relationships;

in the Pre-Nursery and Nursery Years, the support for students for whom English is not their mother tongue is effective, as evidenced by their rapid progress in English;

the curricular and extracurricular opportunities for the students are broad and diverse.

at examination level, especially at Advanced Level, timetables and options are often constructed around the needs of individual students;

the Administrative systems work very well and are well managed.




As with any report there are also areas for development. Next term we will target areas for improvement in numerous self study groups, which should lead to accreditation in around 18 months time. For those of you who are keen to be involved in the accreditation process we will be looking for parental volunteers to join self study groups and will send out more information at the start of term.


For now we should simply focus on saying a huge well done to everyone for achieving so much in such a short time.

Regards,


Mark Thomas
