Bulletin –

Week Beginning Monday 7th April 2014




Dear Parents,



I would like to thank everyone involved in the Bugsy Malone production this week. Students and staff volunteered a huge number of hours rehearsing and getting the props and stage ready for the show. I am sure those who came to watch will agree it was a fantastic show and Mr. Moore will no doubt be looking forward to some well-earned rest over the Easter break.



Please be reminded that school will be finishing at 12 noon today for the holiday.



NO ASA first week back / ASA sign up:

Students should be entering their choices for ASA Block 4 with the deadline being Tuesday, April 8th. School will continue to finish at 3pm when we return until the new ASA block begins on Monday 14th April.



Year 12 University Talk

A representative from Leicester University will be at school on Tuesday April 8th. This is a compulsory lunchtime session for Year 12&apos;s and is the final university talk of the year.



Junior and Senior Prom

We are planning on holding a prom for junior and senior students to celebrate the end of another great year at BSG. The Senior Prom (Years 10-13) will be taking place at the W hotel at the end of April and students can expect to dress to impress for the James Bond themed event.



We are also running a Junior Prom (Years 7-9) for the first time on Friday 6th June. A junior student committee is currently busy planning this event and details will follow in the next few weeks.



We would like to give our students a memorable yet affordable prom and are currently raising funds to help pay costs towards them. If you know of anyone who would be willing to sponsor both or one of these events then please contact either Miss Welch (Nicola.welch@bsg.org.cn) or Mr Ellis (Robert.ellis@bsg.org.cn) who will be happy to send through more information.




Best wishes,



Mr. Iain Ruck,

Head of Secondary
