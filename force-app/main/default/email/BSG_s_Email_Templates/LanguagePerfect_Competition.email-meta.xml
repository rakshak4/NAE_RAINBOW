Dear Parents

The Chinese and Modern Foreign Languages Departments have entered students of Chinese as an Additional Language, French and Spanish in an online languages competition. This competition will take place between Monday, November 11th and Monday, November 18th and students are to complete vocabulary games online that will help with the current topic they are learning.

The aim of the competition is to promote the learning of languages but each individual student and each school has the opportunity to win prizes depending on the amount of progress made online whilst answering questions. Your child’s teacher will have issued each student with a log-in and password to access the website www.languageperfect.com and time will be spent in school this week to show how the students can earn points.

Many international schools in China and South East Asia are participating in this competition and the language departments see it as an excellent opportunity to improve our learning and have fun. Students can access the website through their home PC and Language Perfect has a free app which can be downloaded from their website so it can be accessed with an ipad.

The students’ log in has been set as BSGfirstnamesurname (not case sensitive) and the password is the students’ first name (not case sensitive). If you have any questions regarding the competition, please feel free to contact either Ms Alison Liu (Head of Chinese) or Mr Nick McKenna (Head of MFL).

Kind Regards,

Alison Liu  Nick McKenna

Head of Chinese Head of MFL
