Dear Lower School Parents,







As we near the end of April I would like to offer the following information about things that have been happening on the Lower School Campus and some general reminder points:
Sports Day
Wednesday 30th April will be our Sports Day.
Pre-Nursery and Nursery from 9:00-10:30am
Reception and Year 1 from 1:00-2:30pm
If your child will not be taking their usual bus home you must inform the class teacher and bus monitor.
We shall look forward to seeing you all in your child&apos;s house colour ready to cheer on their team!
Reading Workshop
I would like to thank all those parents that were able to attend our Reading Workshop last week. Ms Helen did a tremendous job of delivering an extremely useful workshop full of information and tips about how reading skills are taught to Early Years children and strategies you can use at home to support your child’s reading journey. I have received lots of positive feedback about this workshop and we will therefore plan to repeat this workshop during Term 1 of the new academic year. Well done to Ms Helen!
Reception Bake Sale
This month it was the turn of the Reception classes to provide the goodies for the Bake Sale. I am pleased to inform you that a grand total of 1,132RMB was raised which will be going to our chosen charity of Action Aid. I would like to thank all the Reception families that contributed to the Bake Sale and a special thank you to the parents who volunteered their time to help with the Bake Sale.
Mosquitoes
As the warmer weather has now joined us, so have the mosquitoes! In a continual effort to reduce the amount of mosquitoes on the Lower School we fumigate the school and surroundings every other weekend and every classroom and shared area has both electric and vapour mosquito machines. If your child is particularly susceptible to mosquito bites please apply mosquito patches to their clothing before they come to school. Please also send in mosquito repellant spray that the teachers will ensure the children use before going outside to play.
Parent Representative Meeting
On Thursday 8th May all those parents that have kindly volunteered to be class parent reps this year will be meeting with me to discuss developments for the forthcoming academic year. Parent reps will of course share any information relating to the school and your child’s year group after this meeting.
Lakefront Car Park
I would like to remind those parents that use the car park above school to only park in spaces that have not been reserved by Lakefront residents. Please refrain from parking in any space that has a designated registration plate attached to the parking space. Lakefront Management have informed me that they will clamp cars found to be parked in reserved parking spaces.
Late Arrival and Collection
I would like to remind parents that bring and collect their children the importance of being on time. School starts promptly at 8:00am. Those children that arrive late often find it difficult to settle into their school day and it can also be very disruptive for lessons if children arrive late. At the end of the day children should be collected at 3:00pm (4:00pm on ASA days). It would be appreciated if parents can ensure they arrive on time.
Collecting Children During School Hours
If you need to collect your child during school hours can you please report to the Front Desk and inform Miss Gaby that you need to collect your child. Miss Gaby will then go to the classroom to get your child and bring them to you at the Front Desk. It is important that all parents follow this procedure to allow us to monitor those students who have left the school premises.
Health, Safety and Security
Every term we have at least one evacuation practice to ensure staff and students know what to do in the event of a fire or flood. Not only do we have to evacuate the school building in a safe and effective manner, but to pass our health and safety regulations we have to be able to evacuate the buildings within three minutes. I am pleased to inform you that our last evacuation procedure took just 2.45 minutes to complete - a very quick response from everyone!
In addition to the evacuation procedure we also have a lockdown practice once a year to ensure there is a planned, prepared, organised and practised response to any risk, threat or hazard that might impact on the staff, students or the capacity of the building to operate normally. Although both procedures are taken very seriously we ensure the children are fully informed about what is happening and make the practices as fun as possible.
In an effort to continually improve our security measures I am also pleased to inform you that security cameras have now been installed in various parts of the playground and on both entrance/exit gates to the school.
I hope the above information has been helpful and as always, if you require any further information please do not hesitate to contact your child’s class teacher.
Please note that there will be no ASAs next week and school will be closed on Thursday 1st and Friday 2nd May due to the Labour Day Holiday. School will reopen on Monday 5th May.
Kind regards,
Miss Kathy
Head of Lower School
The British School of Guangzhou
