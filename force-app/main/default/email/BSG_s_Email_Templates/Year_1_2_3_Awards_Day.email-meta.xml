30th May 2014

Dear Year 1, 2 &amp; 3 Parents,


We would like to take this opportunity to offer parents advanced notice of the planned events for the Year 1, 2 and 3 Awards Day which will take place on Wednesday 25th June, 2014.


This year’s event will be taking place at the prestigious Sofitel Hotel. Students and their families (including older and younger siblings) are invited to attend the awards ceremony for a celebration of student progress and achievement across the curriculum and an array of musical performances from the Primary classes, the Lower Primary Choir and a selection of instrumental pieces. Please note; if your child will be receiving an award on this day a letter will be sent home informing you of this.


The event will begin at 1:00pm with light refreshments being provided and an opportunity to take photos. The actual Awards Ceremony will begin at 1:30pm and is expected to finish at approximately 3:00pm. There will be no school for these students on this day; rather parents should bring their children with them to the hotel for 1:00pm.


If your child is a member of the Lower Primary Choir you will need to ensure they arrive at the hotel for 10:00am to enable a practice to take place before the actual event in the afternoon. Lunch will be provided for all Choir members.


Please note that on this day children should wear their full winter uniform, including tie and blazer.


Further information will soon be sent about the Reception Graduation event and the Year 4-13 Awards Day, in the meantime please save the following dates:

Reception Graduation Event (Lower School Hall) – Tuesday 24th June, 10:00am
Year 4-13 Awards Day (Sofitel) – Friday 27th June, 9:30am

We shall look forward to seeing you all on this day!


Warm regards,

Miss Kathy and Mr. Laird
