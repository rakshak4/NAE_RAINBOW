Bulletin – Week Beginning Monday 28th October&lt;?xml:namespace prefix = o /&gt;


Dear Parents,


Poppy Appeal

As of Monday next week (28th October) we will be selling poppies to raise money for the Poppy Appeal (a charity that supports veterans and families of people who were injured in World War One and Two). The children are invited to bring a small donation to school and receive a poppy. Poppies will also be available to visitors, who would like to make a donation in the main reception area. Thank you for your support; any and all donations will be very much appreciated.



After School Activities (ASAs)

Students should have signed up this week for ASA block 2 that will begin on Monday 28thOctober.



Key Stage 3: English Department Recommended Reading List

A number of Key Stage 3 parents have asked about a reading list or suggested books for their son or daughter.  Extensive reading is a great way to improve all aspects of a student’s English work as well as benefiting them in other all other areas of the curriculum.



At the end of this bulletin we have included a list of books, organized into sections with very brief comments about them.  This list is just a starting point – there is a wealth of good books being published all the time.



We encourage students to use the library to find books that they enjoy and swap books with their friends.



Bring and Buy a book- Friday 1st November

To encourage our young readers and to raise money for a worthy organization called  Room to Read (www.roomtoread.org), we are holding a book sale. If parents or students have any unwanted books they wish to donate to raise money for the charity please can these be handed in to Tutors or Mr Geraghty in the library before next Friday. The sale of these books will then take place during lunchtime when students should bring in 10RMB if they wish to purchase a book.



Best wishes,



Mr. Iain Ruck,



Head of Secondary,

The British School of Guangzhou
