Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Plans for the British Day event on the 15th June are gaining pace. Please click here for the flyer.This is going to be a really wonderful day for families and will go ahead whatever the weather, so do ensure you add this to your calendar. Teachers are planning lots of activities for children and will be looking forward to seeing as many of you as possible. Any parents who are interested in running their own activity or helping out on a stall are encouraged to contact class teachers or the EFC committee directly.

Kind regards,


Mark Thomas
Headmaster
