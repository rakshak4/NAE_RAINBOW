Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},


Today a very important letter containing vital residential information has gone out via pupils.  Please check the passport information used for your son/daughter is correct and that their visa is within date to avoid any complications at the airport.  I also encourage you to use the 2013 Residential VLE page to check all the itineraries, kit lists and flight details for each trip.  To log In to the VLE go to the following WEB page https://www.itslearning.com/?CustomerId=1896&amp;Username=&amp;RedirectLogin=bsgvle.itslearning.com, and input the user as parent.residential and password as Bsgresidential. Once you are logged in click on the blue courses tab on the left hand side.  You will now be able to pick Residentials 2013 and view the dashboard and access each year groups folder.

There is also a waiver form that needs to be completed and signed by you

and then returned to me by 31/05/13.

If you believe their are any mistakes with the passport information or

you have any other questions then please contact me asap by email

nicola.welch@bsg.org.cn.


Kind Regards,

Ms.Nicola Welch
