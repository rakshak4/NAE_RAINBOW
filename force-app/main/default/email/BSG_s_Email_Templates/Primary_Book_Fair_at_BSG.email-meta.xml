Primary Book Fair at BSG


Next Tuesday, December 10th, BSG are hosting a Primary book fair all day in the school library. Each class in Primary will be timetabled a visit to the fair so that students can browse and purchase books.


Our book vendor, Star Kids Children&apos;s Books, have a great reputation and are coming to us from Beijing. There will be a huge selection of fiction and non-fiction books for sale catering for all ages from toddler to adult including lots of new releases for 2013. Books range in price from 40RMB to 150RMB.


After school, parents are warmly invited to browse and purchase books between 3pm and 4pm; the perfect opportunity to do some Christmas shopping! We will be providing light, festive refreshments for parents so they can snack whilst they shop.


On Tuesday 10th December, please remember to send your children to school with some money if you would like them to purchase books at the book sale. Their class teachers will be on hand to supervise and ensure that they choose age appropriate reading material.


If you have any questions, please contact your child&apos;s class teacher.


Happy book shopping!
