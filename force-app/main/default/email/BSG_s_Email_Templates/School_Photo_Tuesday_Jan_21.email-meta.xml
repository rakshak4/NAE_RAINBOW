Dear Parents,

Please be aware that on Tuesday, 21st January we will take a whole school photograph of all children and staff on the Lakefront Campus (Lower School).

On this day, we would like to kindly request that all children wear full winter uniform (note: if your child has P.E. on this day, please DO NOT send them to school in their P.E. uniform).

Best wishes,

The Lower School Team
