Dear Parents,

Enterprise Week

Year 10 Business Studies students have been working hard in preparation for Enterprise Week. The students have formed businesses that will be selling goods and services at break and lunch time to both primary and secondary students. The products range from candy floss and Korean rice rolls, to various games and competitions. Good luck to all our budding entrepreneurs and please note that students may wish to bring in a little spending money so that they can be involved.



Reports + Year 7 &amp; 8 PTC

Students from Years 9-13 should have received their third report of the school year today containing their current attainment grade and effort level. Year 7 and 8 students will receive a full written report next week on Friday 25th April ready for the Parent-Teacher Conference (PTC) scheduled for the evening of Monday 28th April.



Year 10 trip to Honda

Year 10 Business and Geography students will be visiting a Honda factory on Tuesday 29th April to see first hand how the company operates. It is important that our students gain real life experience in the subjects they are studying in class.
