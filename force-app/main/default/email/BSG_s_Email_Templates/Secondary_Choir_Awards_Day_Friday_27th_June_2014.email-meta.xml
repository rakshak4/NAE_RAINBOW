Dear Parents,


Just a gentle reminder to please return the reply slips for Thursday&apos;s choir rehearsal at the Sofitel. (Please CLICK HERE for the choir letter).


Students will leave school by coach for the rehearsal, but will need to be collected from CITIC PLAZA at 6pm on Thursday.


May I take this opportunity to thank you all for your support with the choir over the last two years. Without your willingness to deliver and collect students from various rehearsals, and attendance at events, we would not have been able to achieve as much as we have. It has been a real pleasure to work along side both yourselves and the students themselves.


Thank you,


Miss Rowan




Head of Secondary Music and Performing Arts



The British School of Guangzhou
