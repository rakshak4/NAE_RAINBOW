    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We would like to remind you that tomorrow (Wednesday 25th April) is the first day of our Lower School Maths Festival.

Please note the following information for all Lower School children:

Wednesday – House T-shirts to be worn.

Thursday – Children should come to school in their P.E. uniform.

Friday – Children are invited to come to school dressed in a numeracy/maths themed costume. This theme could include patterns, spots, stripes, colours, sizes, numbers, etc. There will be prizes for the best costume from each year group.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank you all for sending in so many 1RMB coins. The children have been collecting them all week and many of the class pots are nearly full. We will begin building our coin trail on Wednesday morning, starting at the entrance doors and trailing it all around the school. On Friday afternoon we will count how many 1RMB coins we have and donate this amount to Action Aid. If you find any more 1RMB coins over the next few days please send them to school so we can add them to our coin trial.

We are all looking forward to our Maths Festival and be sure to read next month’s newsletter where you will find many photos of the fun we had.

Regards,

Miss Kathy
