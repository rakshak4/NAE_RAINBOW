Dear Foundation Stage Parents,



Happy New Year and welcome back to school, I hope that you have had a restful break. I am happy to say that the children have returned with enthusiasm and are already working very hard.



Please be aware that on Monday 14th January (this Monday) we will be having our first Wow Day of the term, introducing the new topic &apos;Toys&apos;. Children are invited to attend school dressed as a toy for the day. All of  the Foundation Stage team are busy preparing many fun activities to ensure that the children have a fantastic time.



Thank you for your support and I look forward to seeing your children in their costumes on Monday.



Kind regards,



Donna Fry

Foundation Stage Coordinator
