    <textOnly>Dear Parents,
Yesterday, you were e-mailed some Important dates to mark down in your diaries for both the months of November and December.
It has come to my attention that there was an error on the date for the Christmas Carol Concert in December. It should have read Wednesday 14th December, 2011.
My sincerest apologies for the error and any inconvenience it may have caused.
Kind Regards
Mr Dino Vikas</textOnly>
