    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

1-2-1 laptops â€“ Year 9 students
Apologies for the slight delay in presenting the MacAir books this week.
We have been ensuring that all of the required software and protection is loaded in order to make sure that they are fully ready for student use. This has now been achieved.

We have sent the permission agreement forms home with students today for your perusal over the break.

Once the signed forms have been received back into school, we will be holding an introductory workshop for the students and then release the laptops for their use. Please be reassured, that we have secure storage in school for them during break times, PE etc.

Apologies again for the delay.
