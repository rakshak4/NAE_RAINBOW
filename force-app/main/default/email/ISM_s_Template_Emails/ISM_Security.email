In case you do not have your security pass on you, you will be asked to present a valid ID document and wait at the gate until the security confirms that you are on the parents/guardians list.&nbsp;To avoid any inconveniences we kindly ask you to ensure that all your family members have security passes. If you require a new security pass, please see our security on the Lower School campus.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>To avoid causing delays at the security gate, please ensure that&nbsp;<b><u>your security pass is visible</u></b>.&nbsp;In case your child is being collected by a person without a security pass, please ensure that you&nbsp;<u><b>inform the Front desk</b></u>&nbsp;of the appropriate campus in advance and arrangements will be made to issue a temporary pass.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Pedestrian Gate</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>We will be opening an additional gate on the Lower school campus to allow for a safer walk to school. The gate will be available from April 16.&nbsp;<b><u>Please be aware that if you do not have your security pass you will be asked to use the main gate.</u></b>&nbsp;There is also a new pedestrian gate behind the hotel, opposite the staff parking lot. The students can access the lower school campus via this gate to avoid walking on the road.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Both gates will be available from 8:10 until 9 am and from 3:15 until 3:45 pm. Unfortunately we are unable to pave the surface as we are located on a nature preserve's territory and the parents will be expected to make a decision about using these paths on muddy days.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Driving &amp; parking arrangements&nbsp;</b></div><div><br></div><div>Please find attached the map that marks the driving and parking arrangements. We would be grateful if you could print out a copy for your driver or ask your driver to collect a print out at the Front desk of the appropriate campus.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Please note that there have been changes to the parking arrangements on the Upper campus (no parking along the ice-skating rink). We are taking this measure to allow for a two-way traffic to minimize the transport congestion. The cars will be allowed to exit via Velotrek road (to the left from the Upper school campus), however please follow the instructions from the security as this road is not always available due to school buses pick up and Velotrek transport.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>We are kindly asking you drive safely around the school premises and adhere to the speed limit. If you notice any vehicles that are not following the arrangements and are endangering the students' health and safety, please take down the license plate number and report to the Front desk by phone, email or in person. This will enable us to follow up on the those cases.&nbsp;</div></div></div></div></div></span></div></div></span><div><br></div><div>We encourage you to consider the school bus service. The school buses drop off and collect the students at the gate ensuring a safe access, at the same time the school bus service will help you avoid the traffic around the ISM premises. You can find out about the pick up and drop off times for your area from Olga Tenisheva, School bus coordinator, at&nbsp;<a href="mailto:bus@internationalschool.ru">bus@internationalschool.ru</a>&nbsp;</div><span id="OLK_SRC_BODY_SECTION"><div><div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; "><span id="OLK_SRC_BODY_SECTION"><div><div style="word-wrap: break-word; -webkit-nbsp-mode: space; -webkit-line-break: after-white-space; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 14px; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif; "><div><div><div><br></div><div>While we are considering all reasonable procedures and precautions to ensure the safety of the community, please understand that we cannot take responsibility for the actions of students or drivers (other than those travelling on school buses) outside of our school gates.
