    <subject>Update on Student Handbook</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Parents

I hope that you have received the parent student handbook yesterday. If you are still to arrive back in Moscow we will ensure that you receive one on arrival back at ISM.

I trust that you found it informative. Also remember that you will receive Curriculum letters and important dates for the term on Monday and have the opportunity to &quot;Meet the Teacher&quot; in the week beginning September 5th. (More details to follow next week) I did want to identify one page (page 4) that unfortunately suffered from some unintended re-formatting at the printing stage. You will be relieved to know that the children do not have a one hour morning break on Lower Campus!

Please see attached the information for school hours attached.

Best regards
Paul
