Curriculum
Information

 

Dear Parents,

 

As announced to you earlier in the school year, the
Secondary Department will no longer be sending home a weekly blurb containing
curriculum information. This blurb will now be replaced with a far more
detailed curriculum letter. Attached to this letter is the curriculum
information for all subjects for the remainder of this Autumn Term. In January
a new curriculum letter will go home containing information for the Spring Term
and a final letter will go home in April with details for the Summer Term. 

 

If you have any questions pertaining to the information
contained in this curriculum letter, please speak to the individual teachers at
our parent teacher conferences over the next two weeks.

 

Kind regards

 

Mrs. Hamilton

Key Stage Three Phase Leader

 PE
 
 
 
 
 Rugby/
 Fitness Testing
 Pupils will continue to develop their understanding of the
 Principles of Play by taking part in Rugby. Due to the nature of the
 activity, pupils will learn an adapted Rugby League style of play. Pupils
 will firstly develop fundamental handling skills which will be transferred
 into a full game situation. Secondly, pupils will link their handling skills
 with the ability to outwit their opponents in a rugby setting. Practices will
 be set up to allow pupils to implement the handling skills they have learnt
 and refined. Following this, pupils will develop other key skills such as
 kicking and running with the ball which will allow them to be an effective
 performer in the sport of rugby. As well as skills, pupils will be given
 ample opportunity to develop strategic and tactical thinking relating to the
 principles of play. These thinking skills will allow the pupils to transfer
 them across all invasion games. Towards the end of this term, pupils will
 take part in a variety of fitness tests. This will allow them to identify
 their strengths and weaknesses and suggest ways in which they can improve.
 All tests will be retaken in term two and three.
 Key
 Skills:
 -Handling – Lateral pass, miss pass, switch pass, loop
 pass, scrum half pass from ground, scrum half dive pass
 -Committing a defender – fixing defender, attacking space,
 decision making, P.A.S.S. (positioning, angles, speed, space)
 -Running with the ball – Side step, change of pace, the
 swerve.
 -Kicking – The punt, the grubber kick, the drop kick
 -Team work – Running from depth, creating passing angles, developing
 continuity and support
 -Tactics and Strategies – Principles of play in attack and
