Curriculum
Information

 

Dear Parents,

 

As announced to you earlier in the school year, the
Secondary Department will no longer be sending home a weekly blurb containing
curriculum information. This blurb will now be replaced with a far more
detailed curriculum letter. Attached to this letter is the curriculum
information for all subjects for the remainder of this Autumn Term. In January
a new curriculum letter will go home containing information for the Spring Term
and a final letter will go home in April with details for the Summer Term. 

 

If you have any questions pertaining to the information
contained in this curriculum letter, please speak to the individual teachers at
our parent teacher conferences over the next two weeks.

 

Kind regards

 

Mrs. Hamilton

Key Stage Three Phase Leader
