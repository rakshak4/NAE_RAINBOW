    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

Welcome to our latest update in the run down to Easter!!!

1 Social Networks and Cyber Bulling:-


We have recently been upgrading our safeguarding software and procedures on our school network in order to ensure that students are unable to access inappropriate materials and websites. This includes mobile technology that we have recently introduced into school. We have also limited access to social networks within school as they hold no educational value in our context and can be open to misuse.


However, we are aware that many of our students do access websites and social networks independently outside of school. It has recently come to our attention that in some cases students are using social network platforms to communicate in unpleasant or inappropriate ways.


We are acutely aware that our responsibilities regarding student welfare remain within the school environment and we absolutely do not want to overstep the boundaries into family life and parental control. However, we do feel that we should raise awareness of this issue with the parent body, particularly with the holidays upon us.


In order to ensure that your sons and daughters are protected from inappropriate material and messages, you may want to consider the following actions:


1) Holding the password(s) for all accounts held by your children

2) Restricting access/use of technology to agreed times that you can monitor

3) Ensure that settings on all technology available to your child prevent access to inappropriate websites (on Macs there is a parental control)

4) Teaching children that writing comments on any forum should be considered in the same way as writing them down or saying them directly


Most importantly encouraging an open, trustful dialogue with your children will enable them to report anything that upsets or worries them and can prevent problems or issues developing.


In school as part of our PSHE programme, we will continue to teach children how to use technology appropriately and of course ensure that cyber bullying like any other form of undesirable behaviour is not accepted at ISM. On this last point we would ask for your support and understanding.


From Monday 9th April we will be asking that no personal electronic devices of any kind are brought into school. This includes mobile phones, musical devices, laptops or Ebooks not provided by the school. This is already stated in our handbook but we do intend to be more rigorous in enforcing this policy from now on. If such a device is in school it will be taken in by the tutor and held until the end of the day when it can be collected by the student. In recurring cases the item may be held by the tutor until it is collected by an adult family member.

Please be aware that should you need to contact a student at any time urgently, you can always do this via the school office or bus monitor.



2. Early Finish Reminder:-


Parents are reminded that the children finish lessons at 12. 00Noon (Tomorrow)

Friday, 30th March, 2012.


3. Uniforms :-


Following the feedback we have received from parents, ISM will be introducing new uniform items in August 2012:


Our secondary students (Year 7 and up) will have new PE uniforms. The new PE tracksuits will be made from a different material and if it proves to be more durable than the existing PE uniforms, we will be looking at using this material in PE tracksuits for other year groups. In order to minimize the cost implications for the parents we will exchange any PE tracksuits and summer PE kits purchased after April 1 free of charge. The students will be allowed to wear the current PE uniforms during the academic year 2012-13 and the new sets will become compulsory from August, 2013.


To address the unpredictable weather conditions in Moscow during the summer uniform period, ISM is introducing a summer cardigan for girls in Pre-Nursery to Year 2. The cardigan can be worn with the summer dress on colder days.


Last but not the least, we have improved the Foundation stage backpack (used by students in Pre-Nursery to Reception). The new backpack is larger and more spacious. The parents can exchange the current FS backpack for a new one with a 50% discount. If you are purchasing a new FS backpack after April 1 you will be able to exchange it for a new one in August free of charge.


Please note that all new items will be available in August, the date is TBC. In order to exchange the items purchased after April 1 we are kindly asking you to save a copy of the receipt and bring it with you when you come to exchange the PE uniforms or the backpack.


4. Lost &amp; Found


We would like to remind you that any unclaimed items are donated to local charity next week, therefore we are kindly asking you to check the lost and found boxes before Friday.
