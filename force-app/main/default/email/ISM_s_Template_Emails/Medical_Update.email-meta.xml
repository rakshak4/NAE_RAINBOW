    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

We have received notification that an adult on Lower Campus (3C) has been confirmed with a case of Whooping Cough.


What is Whooping Cough?


Whooping cough, sometimes referred to as pertussis, is an infection of the lining of the airways. It mainly affects the windpipe (trachea) and the two airways that branch off from it to the lungs (the bronchi).


Symptoms


The condition can be unpleasant. It&apos;s known as whooping cough because the main symptom is a harsh, dry cough, which is often followed by a sharp intake of breath that sounds like a &apos;whoop&apos;.

Other symptoms include a runny nose, raised temperature, severe coughing fits and vomiting after coughing.


Who is at Risk?


Whooping cough usually affects babies and young children, although teenagers and adults can develop the condition.

Whooping cough tends to be most severe in young babies and in rare cases can be extremely serious.

Whooping cough is highly infectious. The condition is caused by a bacterium that can be passed from person to person through droplets in the air from coughing and sneezing.


What action should you take?


Do not send your child to school until you have seen your doctor if you recognize any of the above symptoms. Should it be diagnosed please inform us immediately and follow the doctor’s advice very carefully, only returning to school when fully recovered.

If symptoms are recognized in any student at school we will inform parents immediately so that you can visit your doctor.

Obviously good hygiene should be maintained at all times.


Treating Whooping Cough


In the UK, children are vaccinated against whooping cough at two, three and four months of age, and again before starting school at about three years and four months of age. The effects of the whooping cough vaccination can fade over time and it is possible to develop the condition during adulthood even if you were previously vaccinated. However, the symptoms are usually less serious than they are during childhood.



Whooping cough can be treated successfully with antibiotics and most people make a full recovery.



Babies and young children are likely to be admitted to hospital as they are most at risk of severe complications. They will be treated in isolation to prevent the infection spreading and will usually be given antibiotics.


Please do observe your children closely and we will do the same in school.


CHICKEN POX

A case of chicken pox has been confirmed in the Lower Campus.

Chickenpox is contagious from about 2 days before the rash appears and lasts until all the blisters are crusted over. A child with chickenpox should be kept out of school until all blisters have dried, usually about 1 week. If you&apos;re unsure about whether your child is ready to return to school, please consult with your doctor.

At ISM we will monitor the children very carefully. Should any symptoms arise, we will isolate them and contact parents immediately.

Chickenpox is very contagious — most kids with a sibling who&apos;s been infected will get it as well, showing symptoms about 2 weeks after the first child does. To help keep the virus from spreading, make sure your children wash their hands frequently, particularly before eating and after using the bathroom. And keep a child with chickenpox away from unvaccinated siblings as much as possible.

It is recommended that you check all members of your household carefully.

What to look for

- An itchy rash of spots that look like blisters

- A fever

- Some children have a fever, abdominal pain, sore throat, headache, or a vague sick feeling a day or 2 before the rash appears.

What to do


- Using cool wet compresses or giving baths in cool or lukewarm water every 3 to 4 hours for the first few days. Oatmeal baths, available at the supermarket or pharmacy, can help to relieve itching. (Baths do not spread chickenpox.)

- Patting (not rubbing) the body dry.

- Putting calamine lotion on itchy areas (but don&apos;t use it on the face, especially near the eyes).

- Giving your child foods that are cold, soft, and bland because chickenpox in the mouth may make drinking or eating difficult. Avoid feeding your child anything highly acidic or especially salty, like orange juice or pretzels.

- Asking your doctor or pharmacist about pain-relieving creams to apply to sores in the genital area.

- Giving your child acetaminophen regularly to help relieve pain if your child has mouth blisters.

What not to do



Never use aspirin to reduce pain or fever in children with chickenpox.

As much as possible, discourage children from scratching. This can be difficult for them, so consider putting mittens or socks on your child&apos;s hands to prevent scratching during sleep. In addition, trim fingernails and keep them clean to help lessen the effects of scratching, including broken blisters and infection.
