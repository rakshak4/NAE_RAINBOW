    <textOnly>Dear Mr and Mrs {!Contact.LastName},

I hope you are well.

I am writing to let you know that according to our records we have yet to receive Autumn fee payment from you. As the invoice is now at least a week overdue, I would appreciate it if you could arrange for the payment at your earliest convenience.

If you have any questions in regards to the outstanding payment or would like to receive a copy of the invoice please do not hesitate to contact me at isminvoicing@britishschools.co.uk

If payment has already been arranged, please accept my apologies for receiving this email. Could you please provide us with the transfer details so we could track the payment and update our records.

Thank you in advance.

Kind regards,

Marina Urmanova
