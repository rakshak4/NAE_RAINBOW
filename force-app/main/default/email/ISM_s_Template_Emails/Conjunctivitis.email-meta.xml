Conjunctivitis.

 

Dear Parents,

 

I am writing to inform you that we have had some cases of
conjunctivitis in the Foundation Stage. If you notice any of the following
symptoms:

 


 Redness of the eye
 Itchy, sore, burning and
 sometimes painful
 The eye may discharge white/yellow
 pus.


 

Please keep your child at home and follow required
treatment. Bathing of the eye with cooled boiled water is recommended and you
can seek medical advice. After 48 hours of treatment your child can come back to
school. 

 

Thank you for your understanding and support with this
matter. 

 

Yours sincerely,

 

Miss Austin.

 

Foundation Stage
Leader.
