    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

Incredibly, if you have ever visited Wales, the sun has continued to shine

on our Year 6 students.


Having spent the day in Cardiff yesterday enjoying a boat trip and

visiting the open air history museum, they have today been to the ground

of premiership football team Swansea City. See attached photograph!


The Staff and students send their love!</textOnly>
