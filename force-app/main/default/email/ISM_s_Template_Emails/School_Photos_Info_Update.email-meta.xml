    <textOnly>Dear parents,

Please be informed that in order to purchase a class or school photograph, you can put down Year ___  class photo or Upper or Lower campus photo on your order form, as all photos have been labeled accordingly.

Class photos are displayed in the classrooms and whole campus photos can be found at Reception desks.

If you have already turned in your order form, but would like to add a class/school photo order, you can leave an envelope with the payment (class photo 20x30 cm– 350 rub, school photo 30x45 cm – 450 rub) with a note (stating your Family name and the details of the order) at front desk on both sites.

Please also keep in mind that in order to receive the photographs before the end of term all orders need to be placed before Thursday, June 21st.

Have a great day!

Kind regards,

Olga Tenisheva
