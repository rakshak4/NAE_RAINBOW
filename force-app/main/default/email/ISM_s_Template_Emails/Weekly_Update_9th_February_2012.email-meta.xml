    <subject>Weekly Update 9th February, 2012</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Parents,
Welcome to the latest edition of our Weekly Update of information.
1. Mid Year Reports:-
Just to confirm that the Mid Year Reports for Foundation Stage and Primary School (PN- Year 5) will be issued  on Friday the 17th February.
Parent Consultations for these year groups will then be offered during the week beginning March 12th. An opportunity to book an appointment to discuss the reports will be offered when we return to school after the half term break.
Secondary reports will be issued at the end of Term Two as normal.
2.  Bus Behaviour:-
We are very keen to ensure that our students continue to conduct themselves in a positive and appropriate manner not only in school but on their journey home. Recently, we have received one or two reports of less than satisfactory behaviour. Please support us by reminding all students that travel on the bus that it is an important responsibility and expectation that they follow the instructions of the bus monitors. We will also be doing this in school. By presenting a common message and working together we can ensure that all students travel safely. Thanks for your anticipated support on this.
3.  Coffee mornings:-  A quick reminder about the Coffee Morning for Key Stage 3 parents (Year7, Year8 and Year9) occurring next Thursday 16th February at 8:30 – 9:30 in the Upper Campus canteen. Everyone welcome, mum&apos;s, dad&apos;s…
Looking forward to seeing you there!
4.  Parents Vs Teachers Basketball Challenge:-
I hope all the parents are out their shooting some baskets and getting fit......as the second of our challenges is nearing! The date has been set for Saturday, 10th March, 2012 commencing at 11.00am. Light refreshments will be available on the day. Please contact Mr Vikas to register for the parents team at admissions@internationalschool.ru
