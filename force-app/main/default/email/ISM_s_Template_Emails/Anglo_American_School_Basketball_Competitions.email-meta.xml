    <textOnly>The 2011-12 season of the Moscow Youth Basketball League will kick-off with player Evaluation Day on SUNDAY, OCTOBER 23rd.  

Teams will be chosen after Evaluation Day, and games will begin on November 13, after the mid-term break.  The Grade K-1 Division will not have evaluations; they will begin play on November 13.    

Games normally will be played on Saturdays at the Anglo-American School, although we sometimes must play on Sundays due to the school&apos;s needs (including the first three weeks).  No games will be scheduled during AAS school holiday periods.   

We are planning to have four Divisions based on grade levels.  The currently planned schedule of play on game days is :  

Grades K-1 - will play in the South Gym from 10 am to 11:15 amGrades 2-3 - will play in the South Gym from 11:30 am to 2:30 pmGrades 4-5 - will play in the North Gym from 1 pm to 4 pm 
Grades 6-8 - will play in the North Gym from 10 am to 1 pm

If you have moved, or if your child is no longer eligible to play or interested in playing, please let us know and we will remove your name from the mailing list.
