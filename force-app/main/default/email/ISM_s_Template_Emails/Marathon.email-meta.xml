    <subject>Marathon Run.......Mr Adam Hoult</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Parents,
This weekend, our very own Physical Education teacher, Mr Adam Hoult,  will be attempting to &quot;TRY and Complete&quot; the Moscow Marathon. 
Mr Hoult is &quot;putting his body on the line&quot; for a great cause.......                                                                         A charity known as &quot;Get Kids Going&quot;.
It would be great if our wonderful school community could get behind Adam (May need a push or three) and sponsor him in his efforts.
I have placed a link below.  There you will find a description of the charity and how to sponsor Adam.

Hoping for a great response!!!
