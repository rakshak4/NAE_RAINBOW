    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

This letter is to advise all parents whose children catch the school bus to and from school each day that there may be delays in the children arriving home from school today.

This is due to demonstrations occurring in the centre of Moscow and the police are closing roads to traffic.

Please keep in touch with Olga (89169955110) the bus monitors, if you have any concerns.

Kind Regards

Dino Vikas
Head of Admissions
The International School of Moscow
