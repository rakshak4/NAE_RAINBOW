    <subject>Weekly Update 21st June, 2012</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

The end of the school year is close but we still have information to share.


Contact Details Update

You have received the contact information update request yesterday. For many families we have two or more contact emails but only the email that is listed as the First parent email would have received the full list of contact details while the second and other listed emails would have received a blank message. We apologize for the inconvenience but unfortunately this is a limitation of our database system.

We are kindly asking you to send us the updated contact information by July 5 to enable us to update the database before August 1. We are also asking you to pay attention to the &quot;Guardians and authorized pick ups&quot; and &quot;Car license plate&quot; sections as this information will be linked to our security database next year.
