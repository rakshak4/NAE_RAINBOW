    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

Following the information that was sent out last week about the Tottenham football camp, please let us remind you that you do NOT need to bring the money with the sign up form. We will contact you about the payment after the May break. 

For the moment we are collecting sign up forms only. 

Thank you and best regards,
