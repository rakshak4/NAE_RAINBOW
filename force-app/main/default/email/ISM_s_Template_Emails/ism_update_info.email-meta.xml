    <subject>International School - Update Contact Information</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.LastName}

The International School of Moscow has recently installed a new Parent and Student management software. We are wanting to ensure we have the most up-to-date contact information for your family, and correct any errors that might have occurred while transplanting data from one system to another.

We ask that you review the information below, and either reply confirming the information is accurate, or if there is anything you would want to update/change.

Phone 1:{!Account.Phone}{!Contact.00ND0000003smeh}
Phone 2:{!Account.00ND0000003Htz1}{!Contact.00ND0000003smem}

Email 1: {!Account.PersonEmail}{!Contact.00ND0000003snHF}
Email2: {!Account.00ND0000003HtZe}{!Contact.00ND0000003smf1}

Address: {!Account.Main_Address__c}{!Contact.00ND0000003smg9}

We would like to point out that:

&quot;Phone 1&quot; is considered the primary phone number  the school should use to contact YOUR FAMILY (not necessarily YOUR PERSONAL PHONE NUMBER). &quot;Phone 2&quot; is the second phone number the school should use. Please let us know if you would like to point out additional phone numbers, in order of priority of use.

Equally, &quot;Email 1&quot; is the primary FAMILY email address (again, not necessarily your Email address). By default, the school Emails mass communications to both Email 1 and Email 2. Please let us know if you would like to change this, or add additional Emails for mass communications.

We thank you in advance for taking the time to review this information, and please do not hesitate to contact us if there is anything else you would like to clarify.

Kind Regards,</textOnly>
