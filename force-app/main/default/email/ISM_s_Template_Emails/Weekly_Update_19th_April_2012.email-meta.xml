    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

Hoping you&apos;re all enjoying the lovely weather as we move closer to the 2012 Summer break!

Below you will find some interesting information that needs to be added to your diaries......

1. Class arrangements for 2012-13

I just wanted to confirm the classes being offered for the next academic year. After much deliberation we have decided not to offer a Pre Nursery class for 2012-13. Instead we will offer a third Reception class. Two main reasons have informed this decision:

1) We are presently struggling to accommodate sibling applications for our Reception classes and if we restrict classes to two again this year there is a distinct possibility that we would not be able to support all families already part of the school, despite having passed the assessment. Also a third Reception class will allow us to keep class sizes smaller.



2) Our Pre Nursery class has not been well subscribed for the last two years, principally because for students are so young, travelling to and from our location for half a day has proved too difficult for many families. Also many students when assessed are not ready by our criteria to start at ISM. Of course families who want to join the school will still have the opportunity one year later at Nursery age level.



This does mean that our present Nursery students will be restructured into three classes with new students joining each group for 2012-13.



A similar situation will also occur for our present Year 5 groups. As parents of that Year group will be aware, we have been over subscribed this academic year. Next year we will open a third Year 6 class to again reduce class sizes and accommodate our students effectively. This means that the student group will again be restructured to support this arrangement.



Finally, we will introduce Year 10 with our present Year 9 students beginning their IGCSE options.



For all other Year groups, it is extremely likely that students will remain in their present classes and move to the next year group together. We will inform parents in the near future should there be any deviation from this intention.



With regards the placement of academic staff in year groups, this is still to be finalized pending a couple of appointments to be made. We will confirm this to you when completed. In the meantime, please do be aware of the school policy of not meeting individual family requests to be placed with specific teachers.



Finally, please be reassured that this will be the final “growth” in terms of number of classes offered on our present sites. We will of course be offering Year 11 in 2013-4 so that our students are able to complete the IGCSE program. However we do not plan to add any further classes until further expansion is secured. We are continuing to be proactive in this regard and will of course let you know should further facilities be secured.



2. Spurs Football Camp

We can confirm that a permission slip will go out on Friday for the Tottenham Hotspur Football Camp. For further information please see the attached presentation that identifies in more detail the objectives and content of the course. If for any reason you are unable to open the attachment you can also access it via our website: http://www.internationalschool.ru/info/ExtraCurricular/footballcamp/en/

I am sure that this will prove a very popular opportunity so please act promptly when returning permission slips.



3. Summer Uniform

At last the snow has melted and the temperatures are rising. However, it is likely that conditions will fluctuate during the remainder of this month. With this in mind, for the next two weeks up until the half term break we will encourage you to exercise good sense with regards to school uniform.



On warm days summer uniform is acceptable but on cold days please feel free to keep winter uniform. However from Monday 14th May, summer uniform is obligatory for all students.  Please refer to the parent Student handbook should you need guidance on summer uniform and should you need to purchase any items the uniform shop will be open each day during office hours.



Thanks for your support on this.



Also please note that blazers are expected to be worn at Assemblies on Monday for all students Year 1 -9.



4. Family Event: Sunday July 10th Noon- 4pm:

I would like to confirm that ISM will be marking the Diamond Jubilee Celebration of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth with a weekend family event. All members of the ISM community are of course invited. Of course, this will be an opportunity to recognise the British culture of our school but please be assured that it will be a day for all nationalities to enjoy.



While I am aware that this is indeed a holiday weekend, I am hopeful that rather than taking this as an opportunity to flee the city you will remain in Moscow and support this social event at our school.



Alternative dates have been discussed with class reps but due to the timing of class residential trips, assessment weeks and a very busy end of year it has been agreed that this is the most appropriate date available on the calendar.



It will take place at our lower school campus from Noon until 4pm on that day. I am preparing more details that will come via the class reps if not before the weekend, no later than Monday.



We hope not only to see you on that Sunday but also support the Class Reps and teachers in the lead up to what should be a great day.
