Dear Parents,

We just
wanted to inform you that Scarlet fever (скарлатина) may be present amongst children in
school. We have one confirmed case on upper campus and
it is possible that they may have (without knowing) been carrying the virus in
school towards the end of last week

Scarlet fever is an
infection caused by streptococcal bacteria, very similar to strep throat.  In the distant past, scarlet fever was
considered quite a dangerous illness; but now it is easily treated with
antibiotics when recognised early.  If
you suspect your child may have any symptoms, please take them to a doctor
immediately and tell them that the school has told you that scarlet fever may
be circulating in our area.

What to look for


 High fever (&gt;38C)
 Sore throat
 Nausea and vomiting
 Headache and / or stomach pain
 A red rash on the palms of the hands, or that
 starts at the neck and chest, and then spreads to the rest of the
 body.  This can extend to the
 tongue.


What to do

 


 Consult your Doctor immediately
 Please
 follow medical advice, and do not send your child back to school until
 completely recovered. 


 

 

Please do keep us informed of any further confirmed
cases and we will remain vigilant at school.

 

Yours sincerely
