    <textOnly>2011 ISM Photography Competition

 

The ISM
photography competition starts on the 3rd October.  The theme of the
competition is “Shadow and Light.”  This will be discussed with our
students during the assembly next week.

Each entrant is
allowed to submit one photograph to the competition.

 

There are prizes
for the winners of each category:

-Years 4-5

-Years 6-9

-Parents +
Teachers

 

Contestants must
bring photographs to the Art room no later than the 27th October and the
winners will be announced in Assembly on Monday the 31st.

 

Winter Uniform

 

Just to clarify the
present status of school uniform for all students. Winter Uniform will become
compulsory from Monday 24th October. (Immediately after the Half
Term Break) Until then, perhaps somewhat optimistically, I am hoping that we
will experience some warm days in amongst the increasingly chilly ones. With
this in mind, I would like to suggest common sense prevailing. In the next two
weeks please ensure that children are dressed in the school uniform most
appropriate for the temperatures that day.

Thank you for your
continued support with uniform, the children are generally looking very smart
in school.

 

 

UN Day

 

UN day will take
place on Friday 28th October. However, just to reassure all parents,
we will be adopting a different approach to the event this year. Upper campus
and Lower Campus will be following different themes that will be largely led by
the teachers and students themselves. With this in mind, much less parent work will be needed this
year and so please do not feel anxious regarding preparations. More details
will follow within the next week!</textOnly>
