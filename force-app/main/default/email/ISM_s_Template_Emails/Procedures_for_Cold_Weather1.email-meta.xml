    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

I just wanted to clarify procedures on very cold days like today.

First of all it is our intention to remain open.
The school environment is warm and comfortable for all even in these very low temperatures.

However, if temperatures were to drop much lower (not forecast at this stage) we would obviously continue to review the situation.

Should we close the school for any reason we would communicate this information in the following ways:

An email to all parents would be sent out at the earliest possible stage. (Either the evening before or early that morning)
We would phone all class representatives for every class to assist with contacting parents

When extreme temperatures or weather conditions are forecast therefore please can you check your emails regularly before setting off for school.

Of course, no news is good news and please understand that we will only consider closing the schools if health and safety is compromised in anyway.

Best regards,
Paul Seedhouse
