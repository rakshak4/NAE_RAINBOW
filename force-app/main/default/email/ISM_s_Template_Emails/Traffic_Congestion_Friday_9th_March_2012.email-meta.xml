    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

This is a reminder that traffic congestion and lack of parking are going to be a problem this afternoon, when picking up your child(ren) after school.

Please be aware of this and we ask you to please be patient and careful, whilst collecting your little ones!!!

Please drive slowly and safely at all times.

I hope to see many of you at the Teachers Vs Parents Basketball Challenge here at School tomorrow morning. Tip off is at 11.00am.

Best Regards
