    <textOnly>Dear Parents,


An exhibition of student Art is currently being displayed in the Upper Campus main hall.


The work recognises all the students at ISM and the hard work they put into their art and craft lessons.


We would like to take this opportunity to invite all members of the ISM community to visit this event this morning (Friday 25th May, 2012) until lunch time, to celebrate some of our student’s high achievements in the arts.


The exhibition provides a clear insight into the overall excellent standards and talents of our young artists.


It is intended that the artwork from Pre-N – Year 9 shall be represented with a variety of different mediums, skills and techniques across the range of abilities,


We look forward to welcoming you to this event,


With Kind Regards,


Mr Seedhouse</textOnly>
