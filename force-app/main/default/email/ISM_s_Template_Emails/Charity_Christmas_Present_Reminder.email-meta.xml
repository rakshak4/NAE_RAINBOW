Dear Parents,

 

 

Charity Christmas Presents

 

 

Following
the excellent response we had last year, ISM have decided again to support the
Khoroshevo Mnevniki Social Centre (KMSC)
by giving Christmas presents to every child in the centre. 

We hope that each ISM
family will be willing to donate a present, with a value of approximately RUR500. 
No one is under any obligation to do so, and families are free to choose
to purchase one present on behalf of the entire family, or one per child in their
family. On the 12th December, we then plan to take a group of ISM
students to deliver the presents to the centre and spend some time with the
children there. 

 

In exchange and as a
thank you, Friday 9th December, the day of our class Christmas
Parties, will be a Non-Uniform Day! 

 

To facilitate this
initiative, on Monday the 28th and Tuesday 29th November
each child in the school will select and bring home a gift tag chosen from the
Christmas Trees on the Upper and Lower Campuses (one per child, some will
select on Monday, others on Tuesday). If
you notice your child has not brought a tag home please notify the tutor who
will then give them a new one. If you wish either to opt out of buying a
present or would prefer to provide one gift from your entire family, not per
child, please inform your class teacher on Monday 28th. Presents
should be delivered to your classroom teacher on Friday 9th December. 

 

The children in the
centre range from ages 3 to 17.  In order
to provide an appropriate present, we have received some loose guidelines from the
KMSC centre’s director (listed on the reverse of this letter). We have also put
together a tag system to ensure that the presents are not only appropriate to
age/gender, but that they are equally spread amongst the children in the
centre.

 

If you would like to
donate a present, then we would be very grateful if you could please follow the
instructions on the reverse of this letter.

 

On behalf of ISM and the organizing
volunteers, we would like to thank you for your continued support.  These initiatives cannot succeed without it –
and there is no doubt that it will make these underprivileged children very
happy this Christmas.

 

 

With thanks and kindest regards,

Charity
Christmas Present – Instructions and Guidelines

 

Please
note: presents must be delivered to your child’s class on the 9th
December

 

 

Blue and Green
Tags are presents for Boys at the KMSC

On these tags you will find the child’s name
written on the front

On the reverse side of the tag you will find
details of the child’s age 

Ask your child to sign the tag, and attach it
securely to the gift wrapped present

 

Pink and Red
Tags are presents for Girls at the KMSC

On these tags you will find the child’s
name written on the front

On the reverse side of the tag you will
find details of the child’s age

Ask your child to sign the tag, and attach it
securely to the gift wrapped present

 

General
Guidelines:

Last year some parents / children wrote a small
personal Christmas message to the children and these were very well received –
they really made the children feel special, so we would encourage you to do
this where possible. For those non-Russian speakers, Google Translate (http://translate.google.com/) is an
excellent facility you can use. Since the tags are very small we would ask that
you write these messages on a separate card and attach this securely to the
outside of the parcel itself, preferably with tape.

Please ensure that the tag identifying to whom
your present is for is attached securely by the ribbon onto the present itself.
If you are placing the present in a gift bag, the label should still be
attached to the present and not to the bag (this will ensure that if the present
comes out of the bag for any reason, we will still be able to get it to its
rightful recipient.)
