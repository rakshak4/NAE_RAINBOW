    <textOnly>Dear Parents,



An exhibition of student Art will be displayed in the Upper Campus main hall on the Thursday 24th May between 6 &amp; 7pm.


We would like to take this opportunity to invite all members of the ISM community to this event celebrating some of our student’s high achievements in the arts.


Light refreshments, cheese and wine will be available during the evening.


The exhibition will provide a clear insight into the overall excellent standards and talents of our young artists.


It is intended that that artwork from Pre-N – Year 9 shall be represented with a variety of different mediums, skills and techniques across the range of abilities,


We look forward to welcoming you to this event,


With Kind Regards,




Alexey Sinkevich (Upper Campus Art Teacher)
