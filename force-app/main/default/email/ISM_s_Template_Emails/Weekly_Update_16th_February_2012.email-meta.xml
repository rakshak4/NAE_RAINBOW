    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

We have a few important notices for you this week, so please take a couple of minutes to read the information below.

1. Lines of Communication for Parents:-

Administrative Queries

It has become apparent that our admissions department is at times directly contacted to deal with parent queries.

While we are always happy to communicate with parents and assist on any matter, we would like to clarify that the first points of contact for administration issues are our receptionists who will pass any message to the appropriate member of staff.


Our Admissions Department acts in an advisory capacity to new parents at the very early stages of the student’s arrival at the School, but beyond this, and given the high demands of their work in ISM, they are unable to pass messages or to take action on matters not of their direct concern.


We would, therefore, respectfully request that parents adhere to the established lines of communication and note that, in future, the Admissions Department – should they receive messages or requests pertaining neither to admissions nor to new students – will only be able to provide the relevant contact number should that be required.


Academic Queries

Of course regarding individual academic issues the first point of contact would be the Class Tutor or relevant specialist teacher. In exceptional circumstances or at a later stage, the relevant Phase leader or Senior management of the school would be contacted.

Thanks for your understanding and support on this issue.

2. Number Plates:-

A kindly reminder to the parents who have not yet provided the number plates of the vehicles delivering to or collecting the children from school, that they provide this information as soon as possible to the secretary on either campus.

This is for the safety of your children, that we are able to keep check on any suspicious vehicles parked near the school.

3. Driving near the campuses:-

May we please ask that parents and employed drivers adhere to the requests of our security guards, to enable smooth picking up and dropping off of pupils at school. We also ask that drivers to adhere to the slow 30km/hr speed limit, as we fear an accident may occur involving a child!!!

4. Parents Vs Teachers Basketball Match:-

The date is set for the 10th March, 2012 at 11.00am in the Upper School gym. The teachers have their squad set and preparing strongly.

The parents team has signed up a large squad of 3......so come on parents, get into the spirit and send in your names, to make your kids proud of you, when you beat those dastardly teachers.

Please e-mail names to admissions@internationalschool.ru with &quot;Basketball&quot; in the header of your e-mail.

5. Lost and Found:-

We are kindly asking you to label your child(ren)&apos;s clothes and shoes. If the lost items are clearly labelled and we are able to identify them, they are returned to the students/teaching assistants every Wednesday to be sent home with the students. If the items are not labelled, they are stored in the lost and found boxes on both campuses.

We would like to remind you that any unclaimed items are donated to local charity at the end of each term, therefore we are kindly asking you to check the lost and found boxes before 30th March.

6. Have a safe and relaxing mid term holiday and looking forward to seeing you all back on 27th February, 2012.

That&apos;s all Folks!

Best Regards
