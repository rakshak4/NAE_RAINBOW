Dear Parents,

We just wanted to inform you that we have a confirmed case of streptococcal
sore throat (known colloquially as strep throat) in foundation Stage of the Lower Campus. 

Strep
throat is not dangerous and is easily treated with antibiotics. It is the cause
of over a third of sore throats in children. However it is very infectious. If
you suspect your child may have any symptoms, please take them to a doctor and if
confirmed keep them off school until they are fully recovered.

What to look
for


 Slightly High fever 
 Sore throat
 Enlarged Lymph Nodes


What to do

 


 Consult your
 Doctor immediately
 Please follow medical advice, and
 do not send your child back to school until completely recovered. 


 

 

Please do
keep us informed of any further confirmed cases and we will remain vigilant at
school.

 

Yours
sincerely

 

 

The ISM School Nursing Team</textOnly>
