Dear Parents,

The PE department is delighted to announce that we have been invited to take part in a Key Stage 3 football tournament in Spain.

This is an amazing opportunity to represent the school at an overseas tournament held during the October halfterm break.  This is a great chance for the children to develop their skills and put them to the test, against Spanish opposition.

The tour is organised by a professional company called Activ4, who will look after the team during the stay in Spain. They will organise everything from fixtures, food and entertainment. During the stay the boys will not only take part in games and training sessions, they will also flavor the delights of Spain. This will include a day trip to Barcelona and a VIP tour of the Nou Camp stadium. Depending on fixtures, this may also include a Barcelona match.
