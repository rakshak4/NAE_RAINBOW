    <textOnly>Dear Parents,



Like every week, the latest information about the goings on at school below.



Upper Campus Sports Day



Unfortunately due to the previous week of rain and the forecast of rain for Friday 15th June, Upper Campus Sports Day has had to be postponed. The sports day will now be held on the Lower Campus field on June 26th from 9am.


We appreciate the overwhelming parental support we get on whole school sports days thus it has been our intention to inform each of you prior to the day of the event so that your schedules will not be too adversely effected.



We look forward to seeing you at the Lower Campus Sports Day next Friday the 22nd and the rescheduled Upper Campus Sports Day on June 26th.


Jubilee Celebrations - Thank You!



Thank you so much to everyone that contributed to our celebrations last Sunday. Despite abysmal weather, I thought the positive spirit of our community shone through. Regardless of the torrential downpours it was a great success with an incredible turnout.


In particular, I would like to recognise all of the class representatives who did a magnificent job in making the whole event work. Thank you to the team!


The great news is that we have successfully raised 141.600 RUB for our chosen charity “To Children With Love”.


Well done to all!!!!


Hat Parade


Unfortunately one event we could not complete in the rain was our hat parade. However, I am aware that a great deal of effort went into making hats by many children and families. With this in mind, I will offer all students that made a hat to bring them into school this Monday (18th June) and share them in the assembly. We can then also allocate the correct house points!


Please ensure that students remember their hats on Monday.


Lower school Photograph



The initial Whole School photograph taken a couple of weeks ago is not in line with the quality that we aim for. For this reason we will take another photograph on Monday 18th June immediately after the Lower School assembly at about 9:15 (weather permitting).


Please ensure that all students look particularly smart, in full uniform with blazers on this morning.


Photograph Order Forms



The photo samples and order forms have been given out to students today. Please select the pictures along with the size and number of pictures that you wish to purchase and fill in the forms accordingly.

Please return the photo samples together with the filled order form and the money to the school before Thursday, 21th June 2012. If the order form is not returned before the deadline, unfortunately we won’t be able to guarantee that you will receive pictures before the end of the term.

Please keep in mind that we will not be able to place your order without advanced payment. The photo samples will be given back to you together with the photographs on Tuesday, 26th June.

We will display the class photo in your child’s classroom and the sample of the whole school photo can be found at both reception desks.
