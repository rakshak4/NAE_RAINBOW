Information Update

 

Pick –Up and Drop Off Times

 

We are continuing to work hard on systems to improve drop-
off procedures and pick up procedures. Obviously the volume of traffic does
make this a challenge but we are committed to seeking solutions.

As laid out in the handbook children should arrive no
earlier than 15 minutes before registration each morning. (8:10 0n Upper Campus
and 8:15 on Lower Campus) Please understand that all academic staff are busy before
this time attending meetings or planning and preparing lessons for the day.

 

Similarly children should be collected promptly after school
at the end of the day. (3:15 on Lower Campus and 3:30 on Upper Campus)
Youngsters can get upset if parents are late and are waiting for long periods
after a busy day. Your understanding and support is appreciated on these
issues.

 

 

Healthy Snacks

 

We have been working hard to improve school lunches while
maintaining a balanced diet. Zarina has been doing great work in that
department, consulting with students and teachers in a series of
“taste-tests”.  The children have
responded positively and have been eating very well this term.

 

As a school we try very hard to encourage children to eat
healthily. (The odd exceptions being birthday lollypops and special events) We
would like to encourage children to bring healthy snacks to school to support
this ethos.

In particular we would ask that wherever possible processed
foods with high sugar and/or salt contents are avoided. Fresh fruit and
vegetables are great choices as are homemade products.

 

Studies suggest that healthy, nutritious food is crucial in
helping people perform at their best. This is particularly true for youngsters.
We have observed of late more sweets and chocolates on the school premises.
Please help us in teaching the children to make healthy choices and as a
consequence perform better both in and out of school.

 

Baker Book Club: Lower Campus

 

We have been able to extend the deadline for purchasing
books to Monday 7th November,
giving families an extra weekend to look at the catalogues provided. If you
wish to take advantage of this opportunity, please make sure that your orders
reach school by that date with the exact amount of money in a sealed envelope.
