    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

Due to the location of the activities in Wales, internet connection is quite inconsistent, however, we are receiving regular updates from the team when they are able.

Yesterday the sunshine was glorious and the students are having a great time. They were looking forward to a super visit to St Fagans near Cardiff.  We will continue to share information as we receive itâ€¦.

Best regards,

Paul Seedhouse
