    <textOnly>Dear Parents, 
 
I am writing to inform you that we have received a notification of a case of Hepatitis A on 
our Lower Campus.  While this is not a cause for undue concern I feel that it is important to 
share this information to prevent any unnecessary infection. I also think it is important to 
keep all families well informed on matters of health. 
 
What is Hepatitis A? 
It is a generally mild illness that is caused by the hepatitis A virus. The virus infects the 
stomach, intestines, and liver. It varies in its degree of severity and symptoms depending 
on the age of the infected person. It is usually a short-term infection that has unpleasant 
symptoms but is rarely serious. Please do not confuse this infection with Hepatitis B or C. 
These are much more serious.  
Symptoms 
Symptoms vary according to age: 
Children 6 years and younger. 
- 70% of the cases are silent; there are no symptoms, not even fever. 
The illness comes and goes harmlessly, and nobody is even aware of it. 
- 30% of children who catch this illness may have fever, fatigue, body aches, poor 
appetite, stomach pain, nausea, and perhaps vomiting and diarrhea. 
 
Virtually all cases in this age group pass with no long-term complications. 
 
Children 6 years to 12 years.  
- 65% of children who catch the illness will show symptoms. These symptoms include 
fever, fatigue, body aches, poor appetite, stomach pain, nausea, and maybe vomiting and 
diarrhea.  
- Many cases will have mild symptoms, but some will have moderate symptoms that can 
come and go for a few weeks. Almost half the cases with symptoms will also have 
jaundice. The illness basically acts like an extended stomach flu.  
There are virtually never any long-term complications in this age group. 
 
Teenagers and adults.  
This age is where the disease is more troublesome. Most cases will experience the above 
symptoms, and the symptoms may be more pronounced and last longer. 70% of cases 
will have jaundice. Rarely, the disease can come and go for six months. Severe 
liver damage occurs very rarely. 
  
If I recognize any of the symptoms what should I do? 
If any of the above symptoms are recognized, children should be kept away from school 
until completely recovered. (Normally seven days from the onset of the symptoms). In the 
meantime it is wise to get them screened by a doctor and inform the tutor at school if 
diagnosis is confirmed. 
Should you recognize symptoms in teenagers and adults it is certainly worthwhile being 
cautious and being screened at the earliest opportunity. 
Should we recognize any symptoms in children at school we will contact parents to collect 
them as soon as possible. This will prevent the spread of infection. Obviously with this in 
mind we will be particularly attentive to regular washing of hands at school at the 
appropriate times. 
 
In Summary 
Allow me to reassure you that in the vast majority of cases this is a mild infection from 
which one will recover in a relatively short time. By being aware of the above information 
and responding accordingly I hope that we can ensure very little disruption to school and 
home. 
Of course, prevention is the best cure. The best way to avoid infection is by ensuring 
regular washing of hands and good hygiene. I suggest that we all pay particular attention 
to this. 
Best regards, 
Paul Seedhouse
