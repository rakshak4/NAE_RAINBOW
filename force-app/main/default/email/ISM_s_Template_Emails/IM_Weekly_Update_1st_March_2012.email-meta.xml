    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

Welcome to our first Weekly news update for the month of March!!!

Again, this issue has plenty of interesting information for you.....so please take the short time to have a read.

1. Summer Term Invoices:-

Please be informed that the invoices for the Summer term were sent home with the students over the last two days. Please, check your child&apos;s blue folder to ensure that you have received the invoice and accompanying documents. If you have not received the invoice, please contact Marina Urmanova, Invoicing Manager at isminvoicing@britishschools.co.uk and she will provide you with all the necessary documents upon request.


If your child(ren)&apos;s school fees are paid by a company, then you will NOT receive the invoice. All company invoices have been sent directly to the payer.
