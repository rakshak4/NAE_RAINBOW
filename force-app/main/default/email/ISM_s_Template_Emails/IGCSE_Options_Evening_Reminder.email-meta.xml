    <textOnly>Dear Parents,


This is a brief reminder that the IGCSE options evening will take place tomorrow (Thursday 15th March, 2012) commencing at 6.00pm in the Upper School Library.


Parents and students of Years 8 and 9 are welcome to attend and weâ€™re pleased that so many families have already indicated their intention to attend the presentation.


The evening will comprise an Introduction to CIE Checkpoint, Cambridge IGCSE qualifications and the subjects which will be available at ISM.


Specialist teachers will give an overview of their subjects, websites will be available for consultation and, during the informal part of the evening when refreshments will be served, there will be an opportunity either as individuals or in small groups to speak with the teachers.


Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.


Best Regards
