    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

We just wanted to inform you that we have a confirmed case of streptococcal sore throat (known colloquially as strep throat) in foundation Stage of the Lower Campus.

Strep throat is not dangerous and is easily treated with antibiotics. It is the cause of over a third of sore throats in children. However it is very infectious. If you suspect your child may have any symptoms, please take them to a doctor and if confirmed keep them off school until they are fully recovered.

What to look for

- Slightly High fever

- Sore throat

- Enlarged Lymph Nodes

What to do

- Consult your Doctor immediately

- Please follow medical advice, and do not send your child back to school until completely recovered.

Please do keep us informed of any further confirmed cases and we will remain vigilant at school.

Yours sincerely,

Admissions Team</textOnly>
