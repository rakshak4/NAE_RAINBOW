    <textOnly>Dear Parents,


In the run down to Easter, we have some informative reading for you below......


1. Final Week of Term reminders:-


Next week is the final week of term and so school will close at noon on Friday March 30th. All bus routes will operate at that time. For those picking up children please make a note of the early finish.


We will be celebrating Art Week on both sites so we hope the children will come home enthused about the work that they are doing in school.

Finally, our secondary department will be following up the reports from tomorrow with consultation evenings on Tuesday and Wednesday.


2. Lost and Found:-


We would like to remind you that any unclaimed items are donated to local charity at the end of each term, therefore we are kindly asking you to check the lost and found boxes before 30th March.
