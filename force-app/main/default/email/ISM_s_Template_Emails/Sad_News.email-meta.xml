    <textOnly>Dear All,
I just wanted to inform you that Sian Andrews, previous head of ISM contacted me with some sad news.
Louise Faragher, the former deputy head of ISM died last week. She has been battling cancer since she left ISM two years ago but tragically was unable to overcome it.
I have not had the pleasure of meeting Louise though I know she was part of our community and made a significant contribution to it. 
I am sure that she will be sadly missed.
