    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

Please find below some very important information and useful tips for whats coming up next week.

Assessment Week


We will get down to the serious business of assessments next week. We have made every effort to ensure that our students are not stressed or worried by the tests that they will face. Instead we want them to arrive at school confident, relaxed and ready to do their very best, demonstrating the progress that they have made this year.


Please assist the students by ensuring they do the following:


· Get plenty of rest and sleep. (Early to bed!)


· Have a good healthy breakfast.


· They arrive each day at school in plenty of time to prepare for the day.


These simple steps should really assist them in achieving good results.


Payments for Tottenham Hotspur Football Camp


Just a reminder that the amount should be paid in Full (R8500) no later than Friday May 25th. Should any payments not be received at this point, places will be released to students on our waiting lists.


Payments can be made in two ways:


· By an adult in person. Payments will be received by Katie (UC) or Sonya (LC) on our front desks.


· By students to their tutor. Payments brought in by students independently should be paid directly to the tutor only at registration first thing in the morning.



All payments should be presented in the following way:


· In a sealed envelope with the full name of the student, class, event the payment is for and amount of money inside.



· Wherever possible please give the exact amount. We will issue a receipt once the Accounting Team have received and processed the payment.
