    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

I know the weather forecast for Sunday has had everyone a bit worried but I would like to confirm that the weather report suggests a reasonable weather day with some sunshine on Sunday and therefore we will hold the celebrations outside on Lower School Campus as planned.

Please find some information regarding the charity we are supporting with the raffle attached so you can have a closer look at what they do.

Hope to see you all on Sunday!

Best regards,
