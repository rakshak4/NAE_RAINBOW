Car License PlatesA quick reminder for parents to please supply Katya Foster with the number plate of cars that deliver or collect your children to or from school. This is for the safety of our children, as our school is on a public street, allowing anyone to park their cars near the school. Please send the number plates to ekaterina.foster@internationalschool.ru
Looking forward to seeing many of you at our Christmas Concert.
