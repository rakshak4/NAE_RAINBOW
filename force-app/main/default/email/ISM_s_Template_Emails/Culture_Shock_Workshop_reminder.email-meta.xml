    <textOnly>Dear ParentsA big thank you to those whom have already registered their interest in the &apos;Culture Shock Workshop&apos; that will be held on Thursday 15th September in the Upper Campus library at 9:00 with Claire Geddes. The response so far has been great, which is fantastic to see. I think it&apos;s a great opportunity to make the most out your time here as well as having the chance to build on your social network. I would however just like to send out an encouraging reminder that enrollment for the course is undergo and if you&apos;d like to join the class then you still have time to register.
