    <textOnly>Dear Parents of Year 9!
Our kids had a great start into the new school year at ISM and I am sure we have an exciting year ahead of us. At the Meet the Teacher night we were given a lot of information about the future education at the school. 
I gladly accepted to be the class representative for this year. In order to communicate easily with each other, it would be great to exchange email addresses and telephone numbers. Please email me following data:- name of your daughter/son- name of the parents- email address- telephone number.
I will put together a list with all the information and hand it our via email.Hope to see you soon
