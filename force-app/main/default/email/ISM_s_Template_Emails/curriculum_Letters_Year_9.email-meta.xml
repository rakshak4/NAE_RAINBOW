Curriculum
Information

 

Dear Parents,

 

As announced to you earlier in the school year, the
Secondary Department will no longer be sending home a weekly blurb containing
curriculum information. This blurb will now be replaced with a far more
detailed curriculum letter. Attached to this letter is the curriculum
information for all subjects for the remainder of this Autumn Term. In January
a new curriculum letter will go home containing information for the Spring Term
and a final letter will go home in April with details for the Summer Term. 

 

If you have any questions pertaining to the information
contained in this curriculum letter, please speak to the individual teachers at
our parent teacher conferences over the next two weeks.

 

Kind regards

 

Mrs. Hamilton

Key Stage Three Phase Leader

 PE
 
 
 
 
 Netball/Fitness
 Testing
 Pupils will continue to develop their understanding of the
 Principles of Play by taking part in Netball. Pupils will develop technical
 skills such as passing, shooting and key movement skills to allow them to be
 an effective performer in Netball. They will practice and refine the chest
 pass, bounce pass and overhead pass which will allow them to transfer into
 game situations. Pupils will discover why we use each pass in different
 situations and begin to make correct decisions in match play. Pupils will recall
 the key points that make up B.E.E.F (Balance, Eyes, Elbow, Follow through)
 which will allow them to analyse their own and others shooting technique. Key
 movement practices and techniques will also be developed through a variety of
 practices, allowing the pupils to put their skills into game situations
 whilst following the correct rules of Netball. As well as skills, pupils will
 be given ample opportunity to develop strategic and tactical thinking
 relating to the principles of play. These thinking skills will allow the
 pupils to transfer them across all invasion games. Pupils will also lead
 small sessions for others in the group. They will plan and prepare a skill
 session based on the techniques they have learnt. Towards the end of this
 term, pupils will take part in a variety of fitness tests. This will allow
 them to identify their strengths and weaknesses and suggest ways in which
 they can improve. All tests will be retaken in term two and three.
 Key
 Skills:
 -Passing – Chest, Bounce, Overhead
 -Receiving – Catching, Body position
 -Shooting – B.E.E.F
 -Movement – Footwork, attacking fakes and dodges, with the
 ball
 -Leadership and Coaching – Coaching sessions to others in
 the group
