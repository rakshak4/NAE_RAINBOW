    <subject>An Update from Wales</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Year 6 Parents,

The Year 6 team have arrived safely in Wales on a lovely afternoon.
Mr Langford reports that the children have coped brilliantly with the journey and are enjoying some clean countryside air while throwing the Rugby ball around.
The view from the site is magnificent - quite literally across the valleys.

The children are just off to the swimming pool before the evening meal. Where do they get their energy???

We will have more news later in the week....

Best Regards

Mr P Seedhouse</textOnly>
