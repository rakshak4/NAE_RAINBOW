Dear Parents,

 

With the first snow drops
upon us this evening………….

 

I think it is of great
importance to write to you all and request that your drivers be extra careful
on the roads and especially around the school grounds.

 

Visibility can get very poor
in the early mornings and late evenings, so ask you to be extra careful when
dropping the children off or picking them up to and from school.

 

Please remember the roads are
very slippery and unsafe, so please ask your drivers to be patient and most
importantly to drive slowly and safely.

 

Please help us to keep your
children safe!!!

 

Best Regards

 

Dino Vikas
