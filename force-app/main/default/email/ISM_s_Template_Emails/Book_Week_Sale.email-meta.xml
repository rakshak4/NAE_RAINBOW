Dear Parents,

 

We are very lucky to have an author from the UK visiting ISM
this week. Rob Parkinson has brought along a book he has written, ‘My Dad’s Not
A Dog’ which the pupils can purchase on Wednesday 12th only. The
book costs 375 rubles and is initially aimed at pupils in Year 3-Year 7
although many older and younger children have purchased the book. There is a
limited amount of books available and so they will be sold on a first come,
first served basis. Those who wish to buy a book on the lower campus can do so
by visiting Mr Frater (Year 1) and those on the upper campus can come to Miss
Ruffin (Year 4). Rob will be available to sign copies of the book at lunchtime
on Wednesday and after school for a short amount of time.

 

Best regards,

Miss Ruffin and Mr Frater</textOnly>
