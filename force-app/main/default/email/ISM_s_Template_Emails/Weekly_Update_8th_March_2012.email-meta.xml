    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

I&apos;d like to kick off the Update today by wishing all the lovely mums and women a happy and joyous International Women&apos;s Day.


Now for the news......

1. Parents Vs Teachers Basketball Challenge:-

When:- Saturday 10th March, 2012
Where:- Upper School Gym
Time:- 10.30am arrival for 11.00am Tip-Off.

The parents team has been busy training for the Challenge, but are still needing 2 or 3 to round off the team......so if you&apos;re interested please contact me at (admissions@internationalschool.ru) to register.

If you would like to come down and cheer on your favorite teacher or Dad/Mum, you&apos;re also welcome......plenty of refreshments and snacks will be available on the day.

2. Wine Tasting Event:-

Please be reminded that the deadline for confirmation for the wine tasting event is tomorrow, however, since today and tomorrow is a public holiday we might be able to extend this date.

3.  Parking for Today:-

Could I please advise all Parents and Drivers collecting children from school today, that it is a Russian Public Holiday today and the Ice Palace across the road will be packed, thus limiting greatly the parking space around school.  Please drive slowly and safely!!!
