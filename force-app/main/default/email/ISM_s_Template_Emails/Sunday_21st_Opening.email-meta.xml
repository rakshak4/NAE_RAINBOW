    <textOnly>Dear Parents

I am currently exploring the possibility of opening the uniform shop on Sunday 21st August, however, in order to confirm this, I will need to understand just how many parents will find this of use.

If you could please let me know by no later than this Friday lunchtime, then I will be able to come back to you with confirmation either way. Should I not receive interest above five families, then unfortunately I shall not be able to make such an offer.

I look forward to your feedback in this regard.

Best
Melissa
