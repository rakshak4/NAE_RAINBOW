    <subject>First Day Procedure (Monday 22nd August)</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Parents
 
I am sure that as the first day of term draws nearer you are getting increasingly excited about the start of school!  I am hopeful that the children feel the same way too.
 
Of course for many it will be their first day at ISM and for all it is their first time in a new year group. It is to be expected that there will be a one or two tears and upset tummies on Monday.  Rest assured that excellent care will be taken of all students. We will be doing everything that we can to help them settle in as soon as possible.
 
Obviously the first morning is a logistical challenge and therefore I wanted to give you a concise outline of what will happen in each area of the school.
 
Those arriving by bus will be assisted on arrival by monitors and academic staff. If being brought by car, please feel free to assist children to find their way (particularly on lower campus or new children to ISM).  Obviously those children whom are older, more independent or familiar with the school are also welcome to be dropped off at the main entrance and make their own way in.
Please refer to the attached drop off route if children are driving to school by car.
 
Also, please be patient at drop off time on Monday and for the first few days. It is likely that procedures will be slower than normal and it may take time. Expect this. By the end of the first week, I am confident that things will run much more smoothly and of course we will review procedures to ensure this.
 
Once at school students will follow these procedures:
 
Lower Campus
(Years Pre Nursery to Year 3)
 
Arrival on lower campus should be between 8:15am and 8:30am. Teachers will be preparing for the day until this time.
 
Foundation Stage (Pre-N, Nursery and Reception)
Teaching assistants will be waiting in the playground and in the Nursery and Reception cloakrooms to escort parents and children to the correct classroom. Teachers will remain in their classrooms to greet the children.
 
Please understand that we will encourage parents to leave children promptly so that we can begin the day with registration and story time. While we recognise that initial separation can be difficult, the best way for children to settle into routines quickly is to leave them at the earliest opportunity. Please support us with this and join fellow parents, the admissions team and myself on upper campus for the Coffee Morning, which will now commence at 8:45am.
 
 
                       
 
Lower Primary (Year One, Two and Three)
Children should meet in the school hall on Lower Campus, where staff will be waiting. The academic staff for each class will then guide the children to their classrooms to begin their day.
Parents that arrive with their children may stay with them in the hall until they go to class. However to avoid congestion on the stairs we encourage parents not to go to classrooms on this first day. Children will enjoy the first morning with tutors in their homeroom class before specialist lessons begin after lunch.
 
Upper Campus
Year 4 to Year 9
 
Arrival on Upper Campus should be between 8:10 and 8:25. Teachers will be preparing for the day until this time.
 
All children (Years Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight and Nine)
Children should meet in the school hall on Upper Campus, where staff will be waiting. The academic staff for each class will then guide the children to their classrooms to begin their day.
Parents that arrive with their children may stay with them in the hall until they go to class. However to avoid congestion in the corridors we encourage parents not to go to classrooms. Children will enjoy the first part of the day with their tutors in their homeroom class before specialist lessons begin after break.
 
Please do everything that you can to assist us with these arrangements. We want the children to settle into routines as quickly as possible and so we ask you that once your child has been guided to their classroom, you leave them promptly.
 
This will enable the day to begin with the minimum of fuss and allow the children to settle quickly into their first morning!
 
While the children settle into their first day we will offer parents from both sites an opportunity to enjoy a coffee in the upper campus canteen from 8:45 am.  This will offer an early opportunity to meet fellow parents and myself. The admissions team will also be represented on both sites initially to assist new families in particular. Melissa will be on the Lower Campus and Dino on the Upper Campus. They will both attend the coffee morning afterwards.

Please note that the uniform shop will be closed until 9 am to enable Ludmila to assist families at the Front Desk. 
 
We hope that this clarifies arrangements for the first morning.  More detailed information will be coming home with the children during the first week, including timetables, Parent/Student Handbooks and curriculum letters on Monday 29th August.
 
Looking forward to seeing you on Monday.

Best wishes

Paul
