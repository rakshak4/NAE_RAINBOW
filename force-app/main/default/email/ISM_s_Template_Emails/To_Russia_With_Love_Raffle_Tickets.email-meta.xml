    <textOnly>Dear All,

Raffle tickets will be on sale during Upper Campus lunch times and at the Lower Campus front desk from Wednesday to Friday this week. Tickets cost 100 roubles each and all proceeds will support a very worthy charity, &quot;To Russia with Love&quot;, which supports Russian orphans (www.torussiawithlove.ie).

Hotel and restaurant vouchers, beauty products, fashion items and more are all up for grabs!

Tickets will also be sold at the Jubilee Picnic, and the raffle will be drawn at the close of the event.

Kind regards,

Joanna Goodhew
