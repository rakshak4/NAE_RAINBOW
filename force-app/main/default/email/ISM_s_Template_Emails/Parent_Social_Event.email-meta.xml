    <subject>Parent Social Event 24th March</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

As you all know, your class representatives have been enquiring as to whether you would prefer a parent social event of fun at the bowling alley or a soiree of wine tasting and fourchette dining. After counting your votes, it has been the majority of you who would prefer enjoying the pleasures of a good glass of wine.

The original idea was to have the wine tasting at the school premises, but taking into account the number of school events, coffee mornings, productions, and talent shows that take place, we have decided to shift the wine tasting event to La Grande Cave. (http://www.pogreblgc.ru/)

Please find the proposal for the evening below:


LA GRANDE CAVE PROPOSAL 24th MARCH

(Grünwald, RublevskoeShosse 30/1)


• 18.30 Welcome Drink (sparkling wine and some canapés)

• 19.00-19.30 Excursion in the wine cellar (in different groups)

• 19.30-20.15 Wine tasting; 4 wines (4 reds, or 2 red and 2 whites)

• 20.15-(time to be agreed) Dinner - Fourchette (menu to be agreed upon,   wine   and soft drinks)

There will also have bottles of Polugar (Russian distillate) for the end of the evening.

Any purchases made during the evening will have a 10% discount.

The cost of the evening will be 4500 RUB per person.

Please be aware that there will be a limit to the number of people that will be able to attend, so as to make sure that everyone can enjoy the evening as best a possible, therefore it will strictly be first come first served.

I will need payment of 4500 RUB per person by no later than 9th March; this will confirm your attendance. 50% of what is collected will be used as a deposit on this date. If by any chance you won&apos;t be able to attend you will be refunded 2250 RUB. The deadline for the final payment will be 20th March, so please make sure you let me know if you won&apos;t be able to attend by this date.

Method of payment:

Please bring an envelope with the exact money (no change will be available), your name and that of your +1 (if attending) and the event name (Wine Tasting) to the Admissions office on the Upper Campus. If you do not have to stop by the UC, please give your envelope to Zarina Abdulazizova from the Accounts department on the Lower Campus.

If you need any clarification on any of this please feel free to get in touch with me.

Have a great Half Term break.

All the best,
