    <textOnly>Dear Parents,



As every week, some interesting information for you to be aware of.



Class Lists 2012-13


Following on from a successful assessment week, we will begin to prepare for End of Year reports and consultations.


It is also at this time that we start to consider placement of teachers and students for next year.


As you will be aware, it is our school policy NOT to meet individual requests from parents to join particular classes for the following year. With the number of students on roll it would be impractical to do so.


Our intention is for all classes to remain together for next year with the following exceptions:


Our present two Nursery classes will be spilt into three Reception classes.

Our present two Reception classes will be split into three Year One classes.

Our present two Year Five classes will be split into three Year 6 classes.


In these cases, friendship groups, gender and nationality/language will be the main considerations in placing the students. Our objective is to establish well- balanced and happy classes for all.


Staff, Parents and Students will be informed during the last week of term regarding the class lists/ placements for 2012-3.


Thanks for your support, patience and understanding on what is always an eagerly anticipated piece of information.


Chicken Pox



A case of chicken pox has been confirmed in one of our Year 3C class.



Chickenpox is contagious from about 2 days before the rash appears and lasts until all the blisters are crusted over. A child with chickenpox should be kept out of school until all blisters have dried, usually about 1 week. If you&apos;re unsure about whether your child is ready to return to school, please consult with your doctor.



At ISM we will monitor the children very carefully. Should any symptoms arise, we will isolate them and contact parents immediately.



Chickenpox is very contagious — most kids with a sibling who&apos;s been infected will get it as well, showing symptoms about 2 weeks after the first child does. To help keep the virus from spreading, make sure your children wash their hands frequently, particularly before eating and after using the bathroom. And keep a child with chickenpox away from unvaccinated siblings as much as possible.



It is recommended that you check all members of your household carefully.



What to look for



· An itchy rash of spots that look like blisters

· A fever

· Some children have a fever, abdominal pain, sore throat, headache, or a vague sick feeling a day or 2 before the rash appears.



What to do



· Using cool wet compresses or giving baths in cool or lukewarm water every 3 to 4 hours for the first few days. Oatmeal baths, available at the supermarket or pharmacy, can help to relieve itching. (Baths do not spread chickenpox.)



· Patting (not rubbing) the body dry.



· Putting calamine lotion on itchy areas (but don&apos;t use it on the face, especially near the eyes).



· Giving your child foods that are cold, soft, and bland because chickenpox in the mouth may make drinking or eating difficult. Avoid feeding your child anything highly acidic or especially salty, like orange juice or pretzels.



· Asking your doctor or pharmacist about pain-relieving creams to apply to sores in the genital area.



· Giving your child acetaminophen regularly to help relieve pain if your child has mouth blisters.



What not to do



Never use aspirin to reduce pain or fever in children with chickenpox.



As much as possible, discourage children from scratching. This can be difficult for them, so consider putting mittens or socks on your child&apos;s hands to prevent scratching during sleep. In addition, trim fingernails and keep them clean to help lessen the effects of scratching, including broken blisters and infection.
