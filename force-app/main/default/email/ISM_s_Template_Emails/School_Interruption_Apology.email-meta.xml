    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

On behalf of the school administration and staff, I would like to express my sincere apology for the inconvenience caused today, due to a burst water main near the school.

Of course the school always places the children&apos;s health and safety at the top of our priority list and therefore, we had no choice but to send the children home.

I hope to be able to follow this e-mail up with an update on the situation regarding whether the school will be open or not on Friday 13th April, 2012, some time this evening, so please keep checking your e-mails!

Best Regards

Dino Vikas
