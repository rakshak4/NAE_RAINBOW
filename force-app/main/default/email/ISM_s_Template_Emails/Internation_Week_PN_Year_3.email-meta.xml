Week at ISM, 24th -28th October 2011

 

Dear Parents,

 

It’s time to celebrate the rich cultural
diversity of our school community. At ISM we are extremely proud of the
international nature of our school. To celebrate this and to develop a wider
understanding of the global community within which our students live and learn,
we are planning an International week at school. In recognition of this we are
extending it from a day to become an International Week of celebrations.

 

For
Years 1-3

This year during the International week each
class will focus on a country (not from our student community) and learn in
depth about these following countries. 

1A- Canada    1F- Mongolia    1M-
Thailand

2C- Vietnam   2D- Qatar

3C- Jamaica   3D- Madagascar 3S- Peru

Your support in helping with information,
books, souvenirs, music, costumes, pamphlets, food and/or flags for any of the above mentioned
countries would be much appreciated and welcomed by all. It will make the
teaching and learning meaningful and fun!

The week will begin with a quiz on Monday
and the celebration of our cultural diversity will continue with an assembly
with international music and multi cultural games (for students only) on
Friday.

 

 Friday-28th October: Dress up day-
National costumes, flag colours

 

All parents of Lower school (Foundation
stage and Y1 to 3) are invited to school on Friday 28th October at
8.30 – 10.00 am. On this day you and your children are
welcome to come to school dressed in your national costume/flag colours/ football


t-shirts. Also please bring a plate of a national
dish to share with other children and parents in the class. This would give
everyone a true taste of being part of an international community. You will be
able to participate with your child in completing an activity set out by the
teacher and then to sample some of the food.

Foundation
stage will continue the celebrations by focussing
on different countries for the rest of the day. Please contact your child’s
teacher if you would like to help.

 

School will finish as normal at 3.20pm.

Looking forward to seeing you all at school
on Friday the 28th Of October.

We are very grateful for your continued
support.

 

Thank you,

P. Arora
