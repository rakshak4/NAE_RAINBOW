    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

Please find below some interesting news to keep you updated with the goings on at ISM.

1. Pick up/Drop off traffic:-

We are reviewing the existing procedures to improve the traffic situation. Meanwhile may we please ask that parents and employed drivers adhere to the requests of our security guards, to enable smooth picking up and dropping off of pupils at school. We also ask that drivers adhere to the slow 30km/hr speed limit, as we fear an accident may occur involving a child.

In the case of you noticing a vehicle that is creating a safety hazard or a delay for other vehicles, we kindly ask you to take down the license plate number and report it to the front desk by email, phone call or in person. We will do our best to follow up on the individual cases

2. Wine Tasting Event:-

If you are still thinking about attending the Wine Tasting Event on the 24th March now is the time to make up your minds as tomorrow, 16th March, is the final date for confirmation and payment.

All those interested please let me know by today or tomorrow morning, you can call the admissions office, pop in or send me an email.

3. Teachers Vs Parents Basketball Challenge:-

Last Saturday saw the Basketball Challenge take place in the Upper School Gym. Again, it was the teachers who reigned supreme against a galant Parents team, who never gave up the ghost!!!

Rumours abound that the final challenge for the year, may surround a popular American past time......more news to come!

4. No Nuts please!

We would like to remind all families that we are a &quot;Nut free zone&quot; due to allergic reactions in our student body. It is essential therefore that all snacks, celebration cakes etc bought into school are nut free.

Also could you assist us at home by teaching the children that they should not share snacks for similar reasons. While we realise that this is often a very kind gesture on the part of our students, it can actually be a problem for students who suffer allergic reactions. We will obviously be teaching and monitoring this in school.

I hope everyone is gearing up for an exciting Easter break!!!

Best Regards
