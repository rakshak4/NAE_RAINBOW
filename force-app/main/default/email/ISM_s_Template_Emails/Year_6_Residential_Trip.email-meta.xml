    <textOnly>Dear Parents

Thank you to all who have paid your deposits for the Year 6 residential trip so far and thank you to those who have explained when the payment will be received.

In an effort to reduce the cost of the trip, we have decided to shorten the length by 2 days. A revised total and itinerary will be forwarded to you as soon as we know the exact number of students attending, which will also determine the overall cost reduction.

Those students who are not taking part in the expeditions will be expected to attend school as normal and a full program of lessons will be provided.

Best regards.
