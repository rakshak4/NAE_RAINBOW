    <textOnly>Speech Day



I hope to see all families from Reception to Year 9 at Speech Day tomorrow for what should be a fantastic celebration of progress and achievement this year. The event will start at 10am prompt in the Ritz Carlton Ballroom.



The address of the hotel is Tverskaya Street 3 and underground parking is available next to the hotel.



We look forward to celebrating the success of our students and saying fond farewells before the summer break.
