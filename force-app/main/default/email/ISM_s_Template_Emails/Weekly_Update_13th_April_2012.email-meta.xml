    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

Please find outlined below some juicy information to assist in keeping you up to date.........take the time to read this and be up to date with the activities at ISM.


*** Tottenham Hotspur Football Camp at ISM

I have received several requests for further information regarding the above from parents since the start of term. I am really pleased to see that there is enthusiasm for this initiative- giving our students an opportunity to experience top quality coaching here in Moscow.

We will present the finer details of the camp next week once costings have been finalized. However the main details are as follows:

The 4 day Football development camp will be offered to students aged Years 1- 3 (Morning sessions) and Years 4- 9 (Afternoon sessions) It will run from June 5th to the 8th and will be hosted at ISM.

There will be a cost per person for the 4-day football development camp. We are working on the final details of that and will present them next week.

The Tottenham Football Development Team was established six years ago and sessions now take place all over the UK as well as Internationally. Each of the coaches are FA qualified with first aid and child protection certificates and have an enthusiasm for promoting Football to young people.

The Tottenham staff will take all of the coaching sessions and at the same time will be scouting for those with already developed skills. If a player demonstrates real potential they might even be given the chance to continue their development at the Tottenham Hotspur Football Academy in the UK.

However, all participants will receive certificates signed by the Tottenham Manager, Harry Redknapp

Please be aware that we have not yet promoted this to our student group until the cost is finalized.

There have been some recent enforced adjustments so please make sure that if you wrote down dates some time ago that you refer to the dates now on the website and presented below.

*** Chicken Pox

A case of chicken pox has been confirmed in one of our Reception classes.

Chickenpox is contagious from about 2 days before the rash appears and lasts until all the blisters are crusted over. A child with chickenpox should be kept out of school until all blisters have dried, usually about 1 week. If you&apos;re unsure about whether your child is ready to return to school, please consult with your doctor.

At ISM we will monitor the children very carefully. Should any symptoms arise, we will isolate them and contact parents immediately.

Chickenpox is very contagious — most kids with a sibling who&apos;s been infected will get it as well, showing symptoms about 2 weeks after the first child does. To help keep the virus from spreading, make sure your children wash their hands frequently, particularly before eating and after using the bathroom. And keep a child with chickenpox away from unvaccinated siblings as much as possible.

It is recommended that you check all members of your household carefully.

What to look for

an itchy rash of spots that look like blisters
a fever
Some children have a fever, abdominal pain, sore throat, headache, or a vague sick feeling a day or 2 before the rash appears.What to do

· Using cool wet compresses or giving baths in cool or lukewarm water every 3 to 4 hours for the first few days. Oatmeal baths, available at the supermarket or pharmacy, can help to relieve itching. (Baths do not spread chickenpox.)

· Patting (not rubbing) the body dry.

· Putting calamine lotion on itchy areas (but don&apos;t use it on the face, especially near the eyes).

· Giving your child foods that are cold, soft, and bland because chickenpox in the mouth may make drinking or eating difficult. Avoid feeding your child anything highly acidic or especially salty, like orange juice or pretzels.

· Asking your doctor or pharmacist about pain-relieving creams to apply to sores in the genital area.

· Giving your child acetaminophen regularly to help relieve pain if your child has mouth blisters.

What not to do

Never use aspirin to reduce pain or fever in children with chickenpox.

As much as possible, discourage children from scratching. This can be difficult for them, so consider putting mittens or socks on your child&apos;s hands to prevent scratching during sleep. In addition, trim fingernails and keep them clean to help lessen the effects of scratching, including broken blisters and infection.
