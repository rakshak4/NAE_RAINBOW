    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

Please find some very important information below.

Tottenham Football Camp



It is been really pleasing to see how positive the response has been to this opportunity. Both camps (Upper and lower school) have now been filled. Thank you for your support on this. If we do receive any further permission slips we will place them on a waiting list so that they can be accommodated should any places become available.


As you know we have requested that no payments be sent in at this time. We will begin to collect payments after the break and will of course inform parents when we would like to start receiving the payments.



Pneumonia Advice



We have been informed that a student on our upper campus is off school with a case of Pneumonia. As this can be contagious we wanted to inform you at the earliest opportunity


Pneumonia is a general term that refers to an infection of the lungs, which can be caused by a variety of micro organisms, including viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites.


Signs and Symptoms


Symptoms vary depending on the age of the child and the cause of the pneumonia, but common ones include:

· fever

· chills

· cough

· nasal congestion

· unusually rapid breathing (in some cases, this is the only symptom)

· breathing with grunting or wheezing sounds

· vomiting

· chest pain

· abdominal pain

· decreased activity

· loss of appetite (in older kids) or poor feeding (in infants), which may lead to dehydration


In extreme cases, bluish or gray color of the lips and fingernails


Should your child show one or more of the above symptoms we advise you to make an appointment to see the doctor at the earliest opportunity.


In school should we recognise these symptoms we will refer it to our School Nurse immediately and they will contact home should a doctor’s visit be advised.


Should a case be confirmed by your doctor please let us know and ensure that your child only returns to school when fully recovered and no longer contagious.


Prevention


We can help prevent the spread of germs by following excellent hygiene guidelines:


· Washing hands regularly, thoroughly and particularly before handling food

· Keeping hands away from mouth and nose

· Always use a tissue when coughing or sneezing and dispose appropriately immediately before washing hands

· Don’t share cups or kitchen utensils with others


We will of course continue to follow these guidelines in school.
