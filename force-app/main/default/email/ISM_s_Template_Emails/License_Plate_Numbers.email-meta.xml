    <textOnly>Dear Parents,
Following suggestions and recommendations from our parents we are working on improving the security system at ISM. As a part of this process we are creating a database of the license plate numbers of the vehicles that visit the school regularly. 
Could you please be kind enough to email us the license plate number of the car(s) that normally bring(s) your children to the school or any other vehicles that visit the school regularly. This measure will help us to monitor and enhance the security at ISM. 
This information needs to be emailed to Ekaterina Foster atekaterina.foster@internationalschool.ru
Thank you in advance for your cooperation. 
Best Regards
Dino Vikas
