    <textOnly>Dear Parents,

Below you will find some interesting information that needs to be added to your diaries.

Beginning and End of Day Procedures


Lower Campus


We are glad to see the new pedestrian gates on Lower Campus being used by the students and the parents.  This idea was in part introduced to prevent families walking on the roadside at busy times. Could we also remind all parents to supervise students carefully before and after school. We have received some complaints from the neighbouring hotel regarding the behavior of one or two students. The territory of the hotel is fenced off and therefore students should be encouraged not to enter the grass or damage trees as they walk by.


Upper Campus


The move to single file parking on the Upper Campus has seen traffic flow improve substantially. Unfortunately we are experiencing similar congestion issues inside our reception area on Upper Campus at pick up time. Our security team and staff are finding it increasingly difficult to track students/ parents at this busy time with so many people in a relatively small space. With this in mind please could adopt the following procedures after the May break:


Parents picking up students remain outside of the school entrance until the end of school. They then collect students from the main door being released by security/ members of the academic staff. This will assist with our security procedures at this increasingly busy time.


Thanks for your understanding on these requests and we will continue to review and improve our procedures with your support.


Receiving Payments for Tottenham Hotspur Football Camp


We will be pleased to receive payments for the Tottenham Football Camp immediately after the break. The amount should be paid in Full (R8500) no later than Friday May 25th Should any payments not be received at this point, places will be released to students on our waiting lists.


Payments can be made in two ways:


1) By an adult in person. Payments will be received by Katie(UC) or Sonya (LC) on our front desks.

2) By students to their tutor. Payments brought in by students independently should be paid directly to the tutor only at registration first thing in the morning.



All payments should be presented in the following way:


In a sealed envelope with the full name of the student, class, event the payment is for and amount of money inside.


Wherever possible please give the exact amount. We will issue a receipt once the Accounting Team have received and processed the payment.


Academic Staff  Update 2012-13


We will be able to confirm the above in the very near future. However there is one important piece of information that I would like to share with you at an early stage.


It is with regret that we must confirm that Mr. Alan Crombie will be leaving ISM at the end of this academic year. Unfortunately due to a family illness he will be returning to the UK.


Obviously we are sad to see him go but are very supportive of his personal situation. Alan has made a significant contribution to the development of our Secondary department in the time he has been with us and he will continue to do so in the coming weeks.


Mr. Crombie will continue to work with the team to ensure that our IGCSE and Secondary programmes are in great shape for next year.


I am however pleased to announce his replacement has already been appointed. Mr. Paul Keach will be joining our school as Head of Secondary for 2012-3. We are very pleased to secure his services as Paul has previously held leadership roles in some excellent schools including The British International School Jakarta and The British School of Muscat.


I will be presenting an introduction to Paul in our next newsletter in a couple of weeks. He and his family will be joining us in August and we look forward to Paul playing a leading role in Secondary development in the coming years. We plan that Paul will visit us in June in preparation for that role. Mr. Crombie and Mrs. Hamilton will assist in the handover process to ensure a smooth transition.


I am sure that you will look forward to welcoming him to ISM.
