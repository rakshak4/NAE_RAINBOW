    <textOnly>Dear
Parents,

 

I am
writing to inform you that we have had some cases of Rotavirus on the Upper
Campus of the school. 

 

Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe diarrhoea among
infants and young children, and is one of several viruses that cause
infections often called stomach flu.
These infections are spread easily. Outbreaks usually occur in the winter and
early spring. Rotavirus infections often spread in settings where many children
are together, such as schools.

The virus spreads through contact with the stools
from an infected child. The virus can spread easily even when people try very
hard to keep places clean. 

Other children who get the rotavirus germs on their
hands can get the infection when they put their hands in their mouths. They can
also get infected with rotavirus by chewing on a toy that has the germs on it.

What are the symptoms?

It takes about 1 to 2 days for a child who is exposed
to the rotavirus germs to start having symptoms. 

Sometimes an early indicator is a rash on the body.

Vomiting is often an early symptom. Usually, a fever
and diarrhoea follow. Most children with rotavirus have very watery diarrhoea
that seems like a large amount for a baby or small child. The most severe
diarrhoea lasts 4 to 8 days. Please keep your child at home and follow the
required treatment, as prescribed by a doctor. Please also inform the school.

 

Thank you
for your understanding and support with this matter.

 

Yours
sincerely,

 

Dino
Vikas
