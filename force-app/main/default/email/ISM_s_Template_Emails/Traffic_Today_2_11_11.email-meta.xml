    <textOnly>Dear Parents,
Please be aware that the Ice Skating Rink next to the school is hosting a hockey match today, therefore the access to the school and the parking on the UC may be affected by this. 
We do apologise for any inconveniences and kindly ask you to arrive slightly earlier to ensure you are not delayed by this. 
 Kind regards,
Anastasia Ramazanova
Head of Administration
The International School of Moscow
