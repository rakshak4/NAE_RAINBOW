    <textOnly>Dear Parents,
The Challenge has been laid........ are you parents game?
Mr Tim Walsh and his merry band of teachers are looking for new victims!!! Thus the Challenge is in place........
                   ISM Teachers Vs ISM Parents Football Challenge
Mr Walsh is looking for parents who would be tough or willing enough to take on his Teaching Terrorists in a game of football (soccer).
Seriously though......the game is far more akin to a &quot;Kick and Giggle&quot; with some light hearted fun!!!!
The Challenge is at a very tentative stage of organisation and Mr Walsh is trying to ascertain the level of interest. 
At this stage, a Saturday morning, either the 8th or 15th of October is being considered for the slaughter......oops, I mean match.
The teachers already have 12 names on the team sheet at this stage! 
So C&apos;mon parents, get in touch with either Tim or myself and register your name on the Parents team if you are genuinely interested.
Will be a great morning of fun and sweat!!!
Kind Regards
Tim Walsh and Dino Vikas.</textOnly>
