Dear Parents, 

 

ISM Christmas Concert Wednesday 14th
December 6pm

 

I am writing to invite you to this years Festive
Christmas Concert which will be commencing in the upper school hall at 6pm on Wednesday 14th
December. The concert will include performances from school ensembles as well
as most year groups/classes throughout ISM.

 

During the concert there will be an interval where
Mulled wine and the nearest thing to a Mince Pie in Moscow will be served. 

 

Students involved will be given a separate letter
which will have a permission slip attached to it. All students involved will be
welcome to stay at school when the normal day ends at 3:30pm. This year all
year groups in Primary and Secondary School except for Year 1 and 4 (due to
their recent productions) will be showcasing a performance as a year group and
all students in year groups performing are encouraged to take part and
perform.  Our Foundation Stage students
will not be performing due to the late starting time. The concert will also
include a few traditional Christmas carols for all to join in. We hope you too
will lend your voice to celebrate this special time of the year.

 

Tickets are now available free of charge on a first
come first served basis from Reception on both campuses. In accordance with the
school health and fire safety policy there will be an initial limit of 200
tickets available for the concert due to the large numbers of students
involved.

 

We very much look forward to seeing you at the
Christmas Concert.

 

Thank for your continued support and I wish you all a
very merry Christmas and happy new year 2012.

 

Yours Sincerely

James Langford 

(Performing Arts Co-ordinator)
