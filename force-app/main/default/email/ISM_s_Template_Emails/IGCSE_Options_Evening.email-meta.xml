    <textOnly>IGCSE Options Evening: Thursday 15th March 6pm


All Year 8 and 9 parents and students are invited to attend our options evening on Thursday at 6pm on the Upper Campus. The objective of the evening will be to share the variety of subjects on offer for students to study in Years 10 and 11 leading to formal IGCSE qualifications.


This information will be crucial in ensuring children make excellent subject choices as they begin to consider their future university aspirations and careers. We have a fantastic set of options available and are eager to share them with you.


Of course, IGCSE qualifications are an important stepping-stone towards those coveted university places.


We will also be able to share some exciting news regarding the International Award and 1-2-1 laptops for our Year 9 students.


Please join us for this crucial information evening and an opportunity to discuss options further with our secondary staff.


WE look forward to seeing you there!



Kind Regards
