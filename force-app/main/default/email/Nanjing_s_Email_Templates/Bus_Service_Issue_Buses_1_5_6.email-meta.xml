    <subject>Bus Services Issue - Buses 1, 5 &amp; 6</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear BSN Parents,

I am writing to you today about a small matter concerning Buses 1, 5 &amp; 6. 

Bus 1 met unusual traffic conditions while in transit to pick-up students living at Masterland.  – as I am writing this, Bus 1 is still on  the highway (8:10am). 

Due to this our Bus &amp; Services manager, Mrs Fiona Gao, was promptly contacted by the driver of Bus 1 and she has diverted Bus 5 to pick-up Masterland studnets.

Bus 6 has been diverted to pick-up Yulan Villas &amp; Bamboo Garden students.  

We wanted to take a moment to write to parents who have students on these buses to explain why you may have seen or heard about a different BSN bus picking-up your child(ren). 

If you have further questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at your leisure. 

Warm Regards,

Joshua Maddox
