Damaged iPad Invoicing Notice 
 
 
Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

I am writing to you today concerning  {!Opportunity.Student_Name__c}’s ipad.
 
As you are aware there was an incident that resulted in severe damage to the iPad lent to you your child.
 
After consulting with Apple Care they have quoted the repair price which you may view in the attached incident report.
 
We will send you an invoice for the repair costs over the coming days, however, I wanted to send you a courtesy notice prior to sending the invoice itself.
 
Should you have any questions, please do contact me at your leisure.
 
Warm Regards,

Joshua Maddox
