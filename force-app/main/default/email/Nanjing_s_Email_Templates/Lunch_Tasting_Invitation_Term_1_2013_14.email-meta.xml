    <textOnly>BSN Lunch Tasting Evening

Dear BSN Parents,


I am writing to you today to invite you to our termly Lunch Tasting Evening to be held on Wednesday, September 25th starting at 7:00pm.


The purpose of the Lunch Tasting Evening is to allow parents who may not have had opportunity to try a BSN school lunch an opportunity to taste for themselves samplings of what is offered to your child(ren) during their lunch break.  Additionally, all management responsible for the evaluation, oversight and delivery of the school lunch, both from the school and our catering company (Bluemax - local and regional management), will be present to answer whatever questions parents may have.


We will also be giving a presentation regarding what changes and advancements were made to the school lunch service in the 2012-13 academic year and where BSN will be focusing its efforts during the 2013-14 academic year, in regards to bettering the overall offering.


There will also be a survey emailed to all BSN families on Tuesday, September 25th in English, Korean &amp; Chinese that will allow you to directly feedback any praise or concerns you may have. We want to stress that the survey is the primary form of giving your feedback, and the Lunch Tasting evening is primarily an information session to learn more about the lunch. The reason for this is that turnout for the Lunch Tasting Evening is usually quite low, however, BSN desires to ensure that as many voices are heard as is possible when it comes to decisions regarding your child(ren)â€™s lunch service.


BSN hosts families from many different cultures where ideas on nutrition and what qualifies a healthy &amp; tasty menu can widely vary, in light of this, we want to ensure that large contingencies of our parent body are not left voiceless due to language or time barriers.


Please do watch your email for the coming survey and, if time allows it, join us on the 25th of September.


With Kind Regards,


Joshua Maddox
