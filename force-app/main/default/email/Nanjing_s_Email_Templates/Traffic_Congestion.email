Dear Parents

As you would be aware the Youth Olympics are in full swing with athletes from all over the world participating in Nanjing.

There is disruption to traffic in many parts of Nanjing and our buses may be affected.  

We also have some VIPs in local hotels and participants staying at the Crowne Plaza which may result in some road closures.   

We hope that any delays are minimal and do not inconvenience you too much.   

Warm Regards,

Susan Barker
