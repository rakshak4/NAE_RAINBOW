Thanks to our parents who pointed out the error in the previous email.  Bonfire Night is November 3rd, not October 3rd.  

Dear BSN Families,

I'm writing to you regarding our 5th annual Bonfire Night (Guy Fawkes Night). 

Please see the attached PDF for full information & menu sets for what is sure to be a wonderful evening spent with friends & family. 

As this year will have some slight changes compared to previous years, please do carefully read the PDF so that you do not miss out on any of the activities.-- one section of the event requires that you requests tickets prior to the event. 

Lastly, as this is one of the few BSN events that is open to the entire community, please do feel free to invite your friends, family & co-workers. 

We will look forward to seeing you & your family on November 3rd!

Warm Regards,

Joshua Maddox
