I’m sure the children are eager to come back and see their friends and teachers after three weeks of family time. We can’t wait to hear all about what they have been up to during our circle time ‘show and tell’ sessions.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Highlights of last term&nbsp;</b></div><div><br></div><div>Last term finished with such a flourish of wonderful activities such as the amazing production of ‘A &nbsp;Little &nbsp;Nativity’, our trip to Jungle Gym and of course all the Christmas parties, Bazaar and crafts. Last term all the children excelled with the challenges of a new school year, friends and classrooms.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>What happens when?</b></div><div><ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our soft start time is 7:45 – 8:30am every day. During this time you will be able to join your child in their classroom to ‘stay and play’. The register will be taken at 8:30am, so please do ensure that your child is present by that time.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On swimming &nbsp;days (Monday) &nbsp;please send &nbsp;the &nbsp;following &nbsp;named &nbsp;items in a bag: swimming costume, towel, swimming hat and easy to put on and remove pool shoes. Please send your child to school on Mondays wearing their PE kit and trainers.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On PE days (Friday) your child can come to school dressed in their PE kit and their trainers.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It’s really important that you name all items of clothing, shoes, water bottles, hats and bags. Everything looks the same so it can be very confusing for the teachers as well as the children. A complete &nbsp;spare change of uniform, including &nbsp;socks &nbsp;and &nbsp;underwear should be left in a named bag in your child’s locker every day, in case of little accidents.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Please remember that sun hats should be in school at all times and your child should bring a fresh bottle of water with them everyday. A healthy afternoon snack is also required (no nuts or nut products please).</span></li></ul></div><div><b>How will your child be learning this term?</b></div><div><br></div><div style="text-align: left;">This new term will hold similar excitements as we have a fantastic range of topics to share with&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt;">them. We will start the term with a topic on Witches and Wizards. This topic is one of my&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">favourites as this enables the children to share their imagination and ‘magical’ knowledge. We&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">will be doing lots of rhyming activities within this subject and the children will make their own&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">‘spells’ and ‘potions’. The first half term will finish with a look at Chinese New Year and all that&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">entails, from food to celebrations, a look at dragons and China itself.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Each week the nursery teachers will meet to review the children’s learning and plan for the&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt;">following week. Our topics will expand according to the children’s interests and you can follow&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">our weekly progress via the Parent Portal. Tasks will be fun and practical, using both the inside&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">and outside learning environments. The teachers and other &nbsp;adults supporting your child will&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">make sure that the activities are suited to your child’s unique needs. &nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>In the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) children learn by playing and exploring, being active,&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt;">and through creative and critical thinking which takes place both inside and outside. In nursery,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">our learning environment is organised into different areas, with children being able to move&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">freely between them and the shared space outside the classrooms at certain times of the day.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Throughout each day the children are engaged in a balance of teacher-led focus activities and&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">child-initiated activities where they are supported by the staff.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>Every classroom, is resourced to support all the areas of learning such as literacy, mathematics,&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt;">understanding the world, physical and creative development.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><b>Phonics</b></div><div><br></div><div>Your child will continue to take part in a phonics lesson every day; we be &nbsp;exploring rhyme,&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt;">alliteration and developing vocabulary to talk about sounds. To do this we play games such as&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">‘silly soup’, where the children add to a rhyming string of words. If the words don’t rhyme, they&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">can’t be put in the soup! During stories, we often encourage children to come up with sound&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">effects, or other words to describe something. We also use ‘mystery bags’. In these the children&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">have to feel an object and then try and describe what it is for their friends to guess the object.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Developing speaking, understanding &nbsp;and &nbsp;listening skills are a very important part of our daily&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">activities.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b>What about mathematics?</b></div><div><br></div><div>The children will be developing their confidence with number, shape, space and size through&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt;">practical activities, number rhymes and stories. We will be singing a variety of familiar and new&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">number rhymes to support their understanding of number (sequence), calculations (one more /&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">one &nbsp;less). There will be lots of practical and fun activities to support their understanding of&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">number. &nbsp;This term we will also introduce the children to symmetry, through &nbsp;art &nbsp;and drawing&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">activities.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b>Modern Foreign Languages (MFL)</b></div><div><br></div><div>Chinese and Spanish language lessons take place four days a week, with learning being linked to&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt;">the Nursery topics and the children’s interests. The Modern Foreign Language teachers will often&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">use &nbsp;both the inside and outside spaces in the same way that the Nursery teachers do, with&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">children being able to continue their learning through play in Mandarin or Spanish.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div><b>Can parents help?</b></div><div><ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We always welcome donations small junk boxes, bottle tops, jar lids, cardboard tubes, corks,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">scrap materials and other things that we can use in our model making areas.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Please log into the Parent Portal at least once a week to keep up to date with school news,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">events and to see lots of lovely photos and videos of the children ‘in action’.</span></li></ul></div><div><b>Home-time</b></div><div><ul><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Nursery home time is 2:30pm Monday to Thursday and 2pm on a Friday. &nbsp;A creche is&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">provided for children with older siblings in the school; children must be collected at 3:15pm.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To ensure the safety of all children, adults are required to wear their identification tags at all&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">times within school.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If your child is due to be collected by someone else please do inform us in advance.&nbsp;</span></li></ul></div><div><span style="font-size: 12pt;"><b>Illness</b></span></div><div><br></div><div>Please remember that if your &nbsp;child has had sickness or diarrhoea, then they are not to attend&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt;">school for 48 hours after the last bout. If your child has a temperature, they should also stay at&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">home until the temperature has gone and your child is feeling better. If your child becomes ill or&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">unwell at school, the school nurse will contact you and request that you come and collect them.</span></div><div><br></div><div><b>Communication</b></div><div><br></div><div>Please regularly log into our Parent Portal to look at the online calendar. This is where you will&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt;">find &nbsp;information about forthcoming events, such as dress up days, concerts, trips etc. Each&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Nursery class will continue to share with you what has been happening in class via the class&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">portals. Any changes to normal school routine will be shared with you as &nbsp;a notification and all&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">important dates are shared as an event via the school calendar, so it is important that these are </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">checked regularly.&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div><div>For safeguarding purposes, can we ask that adults wear their identification tags at all times within&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12pt;">school and if your child is due to be collected by someone else, please do inform us in advance.</span></div><div><br></div><div>Your views are important to us and we are keen to work in partnership with all parents.
