Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Please follow the below link for the latest ASA information booklets:

BSKL Foundation and Key Stage 1 ASA Information Book 2012-2013

BSKL Primary ASA Information Book 2012 – 2013

Please note that there have been a few late changes. Also note that if your child enrols in any ASA’s on Monday, Wednesday and Friday you will need to arrange transport for your children to be picked up as school buses will not be available. Children selecting either tennis or swimming ASA, will need to be collected from the club at 4:00. Just a reminder that on the ASA form you can only submit one ASA selection at a time.

The online registration form will be sent to you on Friday 14th December and the deadline for submissions will be 21st December.

Regards,
Administration Team
The British International School of Kuala Lumpur
World Class Education
