<p class="p1"><font face="arial">Welcome back to the start of a new term. I hope you have had a great Easter break and the children are as eager as the Year 3 team are about the exciting topics ahead.&nbsp;</font></p><p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">As you are aware, we run a literacy-based thematic curriculum with the children studying a different topic each term. This term, we will be focusing on </span><b style="font-size: 12pt;"><i>‘Stone Age to Iron Age’ </i></b><span style="font-size: 12pt;">and this will run across many of the subjects we will be teaching in class. The English, numeracy and science curriculum we teach is in line with the new English National Curriculum.</span></p><p class="p1"><b style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255); font-size: 12pt;">English</b></p><p class="p1"><font face="arial">We will be starting our term learning about instructional writing. &nbsp;We will identify the features required and then take some sequenced photographs to lead us on to writing our own set of instructions. &nbsp;As the term progresses, the students will continue to develop their use of Talk for Writing in the work carried out on adventure story writing. &nbsp;As well as this, we will learn about writing more descriptive diary entries. &nbsp;Throughout the term, there will be a focus on spelling and grammar with particular focus on verbs, prepositions and a revision of other aspects such as direct speech.</font></p><p class="p1"><b style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255); font-size: 12pt;">Mathematics</b></p><p class="p1"><font face="arial">In mathematics, the children will have daily lessons ensuring that all aspects of the mathematics curriculum are covered during the year. &nbsp;We will continue working on a Mastery approach, which involves learning different aspects for longer periods until the students become ‘masters’ in the topic. &nbsp;This term, the students will focus on learning <b>Weight, Addition and Subtraction of Money</b> and <b>Angles and Shape</b>. Fluency of number is a key focus and the children will also continue to climb the <i>Multiplication Ninja</i> belt chart in our weekly challenges. &nbsp;</font></p><p class="p1"><b style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255); font-size: 12pt;">Science</b></p><p class="p1"><font face="arial">Our science topics this term are ‘Rocks’ and ‘Animals, including Humans’. We planned to do this topic last term but, instead, changed it to ‘Light’. When we study animals, including humans, they will learn to identify how different animals have skeletons and muscles for different support, protection and movement. Within the topic about rocks, the students will use branching databases to identify specific rocks and be able to sort rocks into types.</font></p><p class="p1"><b style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255); font-size: 12pt;">Computing</b></p><p class="p1"><font face="arial">In computing this term, the students will work on becoming more familiar with Google Drive and other functions that Google offer. &nbsp;They will also be using Garage Band, linked to their lessons in music. &nbsp;Creating a book on Book Creator will also complement literacy work showing the different traditional tales that were written last term.</font></p><p class="p1"><b style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255); font-size: 12pt;">Integrated Curriculum</b></p><p class="p1"><font face="arial">In topic sessions, our theme will be ‘<i>Stone Age to Iron Age</i>’. This will cover a range of areas including: understanding the concept of change over time; developing their knowledge of chronology; making deductions about the life of people during the Stone Age based on artefacts and images; investigating how people in the Stone Age farmed.</font></p><p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In art and design this term, we will complete a textiles project linked to our topic whereby the children will learn different types of stitch. &nbsp;They will also be given the chance to create their own Stone Age designs using clay.</span></p><p class="p1"><b style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255); font-size: 12pt;">Modern Foreign Languages (MFL)</b></p><p class="p1"><font face="arial">Year 3 children will continue studying either Mandarin or Spanish. Mandarin lessons are differentiated by ability due to the wide range of competency amongst our children.&nbsp;</font></p><p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In Term 3, the Mandarin lessons for Basic level will be covering the topics of “Stationery and classroom objects”, “Colours”, “Fruits” and “Animals”.</span></p><p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Beginner level will be covering the topics of “Animals”, “Colours”, “Adjectives and body parts” and “Countries and Languages”.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Heritage group will be focusing on the passage, “</span><i style="font-size: 12pt;">Chen Lao Shi Jiao Wo Men Zhong Wen Ke</i><span style="font-size: 12pt;">” (Chen Lao Shi teaches us Mandarin), “</span><i style="font-size: 12pt;">Wo Gei Ma Ma Yi Jian Li Wu</i><span style="font-size: 12pt;">” (I Give Mummy a Present), “Grandma Treats us to Chinese Dishes” and “</span><i style="font-size: 12pt;">Xiao Hong Xi Huan Kan Dian Ying</i><span style="font-size: 12pt;">” (Xiao Hong Likes to Watch Movies). Besides that, this group will be extended further by learning a wider range of vocabulary and writing descriptions of characters.</span></p><p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Year 3 Spanish group will be covering a number of short topics this term including:- </span><i style="font-size: 12pt;">My Bedroom, The Cafe, food and drink, Hobbies and Sports, Wild Animals and Habitats and Spanish Summer Festivals</i><span style="font-size: 12pt;">. The children will be learning through creative activities, games, songs and stories. They will be encouraged to give their opinions and say what they like and dislike to develop their fluency and confidence. The topics will also enable the children to develop their grammar and use of verbs and adjectives. The children will also be preparing to perform in the Spanish assembly in the third term.</span></p><p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In Bahasa, the children will build up their vocabulary and speaking skills focusing on Musical Instruments.</span></p><p class="p1"><b style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255); font-size: 12pt;">Music</b></p><p class="p1"><font face="arial">The first topic in music this term is ‘<i>Painting With Sound: Exploring Sound Colours</i>’. &nbsp;The children will explore the link between music and how it can create images and represent stories. They will work in groups to create soundscapes and musical accompaniment to written narrative. &nbsp;We will then move onto learning ‘<i>Salt Pepper Vinegar Mustard: Exploring Signals'</i>. This topic will explore playground rhymes, skipping games and ditties. The children will learn a variety of these through a range of activities that they can transfer into the playground and at home</font></p><p class="p1"><b style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255); font-size: 12pt;">PE</b></p><p class="p1"><font face="arial">In their PE lessons, over the course of Term 3, the Year 3 children will take part in the following activities: &nbsp;unihoc, Outdoor and Adventurous Activities (OAA, including the climbing wall), badminton skills, general team game skills, athletics (in preparation for Sports Day) and dance. &nbsp;These activities will be rotated throughout the term, so that by the end of term 3, all classes will have completed all the PE activities on the year 3 PE curriculum. &nbsp;The children will require a hat for PE, as some of these activities will take place on the primary roof space.&nbsp;</font></p><p class="p1"><b style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255); font-size: 12pt;">Homework</b></p><p class="p1"><font face="arial">Homework will continue to be sent out on a Wednesday by the class teacher and this will include approximately 30 minutes of maths and 30 minutes of English or Topic/Science work. Occasionally, a task may be set which we will allow more time for completion, however we will inform you of this when it occurs. Spelling rules will be sent out each Wednesday. The children will also receive weekly homework from their Modern Foreign Languages teacher – Spanish or Mandarin (MFL).</font></p><p class="p1"><b style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255); font-size: 12pt;">Communication</b></p><p class="p1"><font face="arial">Each Year 3 class will continue to share with you what has been happening in class via the class portals; any changes to normal school routine or important dates or events will be shared with you via the school calendar, so it is important that these are checked regularly.&nbsp;</font></p><p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">For safeguarding purposes, we ask that adults wear their identification tags at all times within school and if your child is due to be collected by someone else, please do inform us in advance.</span></p><p class="p1"><b style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255); font-size: 12pt;">Events to look forward to this term:</b></p><p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">29th April</span><span class="Apple-tab-span" style="font-size: 12pt; white-space: pre;">				</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Open Morning</span></p><p class="p1"><font face="arial">5th May <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">				</span>Year 3 sports day</font></p><p class="p1"><font face="arial">13th May <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">				</span>3B Class assembly</font></p><p class="p1"><font face="arial">27th May <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">				</span>3C Class assembly</font></p><p class="p1"><font face="arial">1st June <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">				</span>Pupil Led consultations</font></p><p class="p1"><font face="arial">17th June<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">				</span>3D Class assembly <span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">	</span></font></p><p class="p1"><font face="arial">Friday, 1st July<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">			</span>International Day (children to dress up)</font></p><p class="p1"><font face="arial">Tuesday, 12th July<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre">		</span>Hari Raya Celebration Day (children to dress up)</font></p><p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">I hope this letter gives you a brief insight into what your child will be learning this term.
