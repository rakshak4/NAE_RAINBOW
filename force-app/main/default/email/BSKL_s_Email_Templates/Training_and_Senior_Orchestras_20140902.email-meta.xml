Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Training and Senior Orchestras

Our Training and Senior Orchestras will be meeting every Monday from 3.30-4.30pm from Monday 15th September onwards. For existing members and those children new to the school who play an orchestral instrument, more information on both of these ensembles can be found in the following PDF documents:

If your child wishes to sign up, please complete the form at the following link:

Also on offer every Tuesday from 3.30-4.30pm there will be two more exciting ensemble groups: the Saxophone Ensemble (Year 5-10) and also a Folk Band (Year 7-10). These groups are by invitation only.

Please note, if your child goes home by bus on either of these days, they would need to make alternative transport arrangements since the bus will not leave at this later time.

We very much look forward to another exciting year ahead of music making!

Best wishes from the Music Teamâ€‹
