Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName}

Year 5 Curriculum – Term 3



I trust you all had a good break; I cannot believe we are already in our final term of Year 5.  Please find below an outline of the curriculum that the children will cover in Term 3. At BSKL, we run a literacy-based, thematic curriculum with the children studying a different theme each term. This term we we will be focusing on two topics: ‘Out of this World’ and in the second half term, ‘Decades of Famous People’. As last term, the English, mathematics and science curriculum we teach is in line with the new English National Curriculum.



English



Inspired by our Space-based topic, creative writing and explanations are the key focus this half term for our literacy work. We will be delving into science fiction, culminating in an extended piece of fiction writing. The children will be focusing on using a range of figurative language, developing their skills in planning a story and editing their work to improve it.  The children will also try to explain many of the phenomena in space, whilst learning the key features and structure of an explanation text. Weekly spellings will continue to be given and grammar and punctuation will remain as part of the targets that the children are set throughout their writing.  Children will continue to be encouraged to choose from range of texts in the library and take part in weekly guided reading sessions in class.



Mathematics



The daily maths lessons continue to cover all aspects of mathematics curriculum, including ordering and sequencing positive and negative numbers, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of whole numbers and decimals, conversion of metric units, fractions, decimals and percentages and ratio and proportion of number.  Improving fluency, knowledge of times tables and corresponding division facts up to 12x12 continues to be weekly focus in Maths Ninjas.



The Friday focus session on problem solving relating to the week’s topics has been a success and will continue this term to enable the pupils to apply the mathematical skills they are learning in more practical and challenging situations.



Science



The &apos;Earth, Sun and Moon&apos; is the focus for our topic in the first half term.  The children will learn facts and figures about our galaxy and explore the planets of the solar system.  They will also research and investigate early space travel from a historical perspective; acknowledging the different sources of historical evidence and the validity and reliability of each.



Computing



This term, as well as continuing to look at E-Safety, we will also focus on 3D augmentation, using the Aurasma app as a platform to create and unlock a layer of digital information, from selected objects.  We will also take a first look at web design and the uses of a web page.



Topic



In the first half term the focus will be very much science based.  The children will not only discover new facts and figures about the galaxy, they will also research and investigate early space travel from a historical perspective; acknowledging the different sources of historical evidence and the validity and reliability of each. In the second half term, they will have a whistle stop tour of recent history from the 1920s to the 1990s through getting to know a variety of famous people from different fields of expertise and look at the impact they had on the development of society. The information the children collect will then be presented in a web page to link with their computing skills



MFL



In Mandarin, the different groups will tackle the following topics:



Basic: Food and Beverage, School and Uniform, Stationery and My House

Beginner: Time and Routine, Food and Beverage, Transportation and Hobbies

Elementary: Fast food and Desserts, Healthy food, Transportation and Currency

Intermediate: Leisure activities, Culture, Sickness and Health



In Spanish, the children will be covering a number of short topics: Animals, including farm and wild animals, Vegetables and Fruits, Time, including daily routines, Transport and Summer Festivals in Spain. Throughout the topic work we will be incorporating lots of new vocabulary and using songs, role-play, stories and creative activities to continue to develop the children&apos;s speaking, reading and writing skills in Spanish.



This term, Year 5 Bahasa students will focus on two topics: ‘Musical Instruments’ and ‘Clothes’.



Music



In addition to the PIPS (Primary Instrumental Programme), the children also have one music lesson a week. The topics covered in music are ‘Journey into Space’ (to complement our topic) in which the children explore sources of sound and ‘Who Knows?’  in which the children will investigate musical processes.



PE



In PE, the Year 5 children will continue with their swimming lessons on the same day as in Term 2.  In their other two lessons, they will be introduced to Outdoor and Adventurous Activities (OAA), which will include using the climbing wall/bouldering area, team building and orienteering activities.  They will also be focusing on skills in football and/or tag rugby.  Group B PE will get the opportunity to play badminton (as they did volleyball last term) and the other groups will be introduced to volleyball skills.  These activities will be rotated throughout Term 3.



Homework



For homework, all children at BSKL are encouraged to read daily.  In Year 5, the children will be given two pieces of homework each week; each piece should take approximately 40 minutes.  One piece will be literacy based, and will often relate to the topic in class, and one piece will be mathematics.  Children will also bring home a list of spellings and are expected to be recapping their times tables/corresponding division facts and other number facts to improve their fluency. The Modern Foreign Language (MFL) team (Mandarin/Bahasa/Spanish), will also be setting a weekly piece of homework.



All children now have access to the MyMaths website and should have received a username and password that can be used at home. Spending short, but regular, sessions playing educational Maths games will help consolidate learning and also give opportunities to develop new mathematical skills.



Events to look forward to include:



Monday,  18th May  Year 5 &amp; 6 Sports Day

Friday, 22nd  May  5D Class Assembly

Thursday 11th June Primary Open Day

Friday, 12th June  KS2 Parents ‘Coffee and Chat’



Each Year 5 class will continue to share with you what has been happening in class via the class Parent Portal blogs. Any changes to normal school routine or important dates or events will be shared with you via the school calendar and we encourage parents to access the Parent Portal regularly.



For safeguarding purposes, can we ask that adults wear their identification tags at all times within school and if your child is due to be collected by someone else, please do inform us in advance.



I hope this letter gives you a brief insight into what your child will be learning this term. As always, if you have any questions or concerns please contact your class teacher as a first point of contact.



Kind regards,



The Year 5 Team
