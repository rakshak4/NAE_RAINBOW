Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Due to Parent/Teacher consultations all ASA’s and swimming practices at The Club are cancelled during this week.

They will all be postponed to the following week (w/c 3rd December).  This will be the last week of ASA’s for this term.   We are very sorry for any inconvenience this may cause.

Furthermore for those families that use the school bus service please take note:

• The bus service will resume it’s leaving time of 3pm from school on   the Parent/Teacher consultation evenings.  Should students that regularly take the school bus not be using the service please inform the school bus co-ordinator Lidia accordingly.
• For the postponed ASA’s w/c 3rd December on the ASA days the school bus will leave at 4pm instead of 3pm on Tuesday and Thursday to accommodate the changes.

As well kindly be aware of the following:

• All details pertaining to the swimming practices at The Club remain the same.
• For any paid ASA’s there will be a refund of 1 week due to only 7 weeks of paid ASA’s this term instead of 8.

Kind Regards,

Administration Team
The British International School of Kuala Lumpur
