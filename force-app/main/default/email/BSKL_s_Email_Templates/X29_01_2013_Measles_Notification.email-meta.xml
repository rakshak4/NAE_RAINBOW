Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

There has been a suspected case of measles in school. Measles spreads very easily by air and by direct contact.  Simply being in the same room with someone who has measles is sufficient to become infected. However, because measles is so contagious we want to provide you with information.

Usually about 8-12 days (but up to 21 days) after exposure, measles begins with a mild to moderate fever accompanied by cough, runny nose, and red eyes. Two or three days later, the fever spikes, often as high as 40°C. At the same time, a red blotchy rash appears, usually first on the face, along the hairline and behind the ears. The rash rapidly spreads downward to the chest and back and, finally, to the thighs and feet.  Most students with measles are sick enough that they miss at least a week of school.  One in every 20 people with measles develops pneumonia and, more rarely, serious, even life-threatening complications can occur.
Your child is at risk of developing measles if she/he has never had the disease or has never received the measles vaccine.  This is also true for any adult (particularly pregnant women) or child in your household who has never had measles or the immunization if they are exposed to someone with measles.
Measles vaccine, which is given in combination with rubella and mumps vaccine (MMR) is effective and safe and two doses are recommended for children. If your child has not received MMR vaccine or has only received one dose, we recommend that you contact your healthcare provider for immunization as soon as possible.

If your child develops an illness with fever (38.3°C or more), cough, runny nose or red eyes, with or without rash, contact your healthcare provider for diagnosis and treatment, and keep your child at home until the doctor and the school staff have cleared him/her to return.


Sincerely,
Azilah Chan
