The story is set in the deserts of Texas in the United States of America and so provides another opportunity for the children to learn about a contrasting biome to Malaysia. &nbsp;The children will have the opportunity to consolidate their writing skills through persuasive writing, information text, explanatory writing and poetry. Following assessments last term, each child will know their target in writing and become very aware of the next steps towards improvement. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Mathematics</b></div><div>This term, we are going to begin by focusing on geometry of shape. &nbsp;The children will investigate 2D and 3D shapes, identifying their properties and solve problems using this information. &nbsp;They will need to understand that angles are measured in degrees and use this in rotating shapes 90 degrees. &nbsp;They will also be expected to accurately draw straight lines to the nearest millimetre and begin to make connections between length of sides and diagonals of a shape. &nbsp;We will introduce the children to percentages, linking them with fractions and decimals. They will investigate fractions of both number and shape. &nbsp;We will continue with a weekly focus session on problem solving relating to the weeks topics, to give the pupils the opportunity to apply the mathematical skills they are learning in more practical and challenging situations. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Science</b></div><div>To complement our Biomes topic perfectly, this term we are going to take a look at lifecycles. &nbsp;The outcome will be that the children will be able to identify differences between the life cycle of a mammal, amphibian, insect and a bird. &nbsp;We will also look at the plants of the biome, specifically the reproduction process and how that will differ across biomes due to the effect of climate and the environment they live in.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Computing</b></div><div>Coding is the main area of learning for this term. &nbsp;The children will build on their skills from last year and look at how computer games are coded. &nbsp;The children will have the opportunity to share their learning with adults so each class will be inviting parents to come into school and learn with the children for one session.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Modern Foreign Languages (MFL)</b></div><div>In Term 2, the Mandarin lessons in Year 5 for beginners will be covering the topics of “Chinese Zodiac”, “Birthday” and “Days of week and Month”. Elementary level will be covering the topics of “Friends”, “Appearance description” and “Clothing”. Intermediate level will be covering the topics of “School Facilities” and “Imperative Sentence”.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>All levels will continue to develop children's listening, speaking, reading and writing skills. Besides this, children will also learning Chinese New Year traditions and culture in Term 2.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>In Spanish, the vocabulary focus will be body parts and clothes, including adverbs to describe them and then food and drinks including, reading and ordering from a menu (very useful if you are planning a trip to Spain).</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>This term, Year 5 Bahasa students will focus on two topics: sports and traditional games, as well as food and drinks. They will have fun discovering new words for the themes mentioned above and engage in plenty of games and food and drinks related activities.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Music</b></div><div>In addition to the PIPS, (Primary Instrumental Programme) the children also have one music lesson a week. They will be completing a unit of work entitled ‘Stars, Hide your Fires’ focusing on performing together and the second unit, ‘Songwriter’ gives the children opportunity to compose their own lyrics and melody.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Physical Education (PE)</b></div><div>In their PE lessons, over the course of Term 2 and the start of Term 3, the Year 5 children will take part in the following activities: &nbsp;football, athletics, T-Ball, unihoc, badminton and the Young Leaders Award. &nbsp;The Young Leaders Award involves the children learning how to lead younger children in suitable activities. &nbsp;They will have the opportunity to put this into practice and also use their leadership skills at the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) and Key Stage 1 Sports Days in Term 3. &nbsp;These activities will be rotated throughout the term to ensure all groups can take part in all activities. The children will continue to be grouped by ability and will be assessed throughout the term, in order that we can move pupils accordingly. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Homework</b></div><div>For homework, all children at BSKL are encouraged to read daily. &nbsp;In Year 5, the children will be given two pieces of homework each week; each piece should take approximately 40 minutes. &nbsp;One piece will be literacy based and will more than likely relate to the topic in class and one piece will be mathematics. &nbsp;Children will also bring home a list of spellings and are expected to be recapping on their times tables/corresponding division facts and other number facts to improve their fluency. &nbsp;Your child will be given an online Mymaths account and this may sometimes be accessed to complete homework tasks. &nbsp;As well as homework, Mymaths has maths games and lessons so please encourage your child to make use of this resource as much as possible. &nbsp;The Modern Foreign Language (MFL) team (Mandarin/Bahasa/Spanish), will also be setting a weekly piece of homework.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Communication</b></div><div>Each Year 5 class will continue to share with you what is happening in class via the class portal blogs. Any changes to normal school routine or important dates/events will be shared via the school calendar. Although a notification e-mail may be sent, we encourage parents to check the Parent Portal calendar regularly.</div><div><br></div><div>For safeguarding purposes, can we ask that adults wear their identification tags at all times within school and if your child is due to be collected by someone else, please do inform us in advance.</div><div><br></div><div>I hope this letter gives you a brief insight into what your child will be learning this term. As always, if you have any questions or concerns please contact your class teacher as a first point of contact.</div><div><br></div><div>Kind regards,</div><div><b>Year 5 Team</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Emily Keen (Year Group Leader) &amp; Ms Michelle</div><div>emily.keen@britishschool.edu.my</div><div><br></div><div>Sean Allday &amp; Ms Jenni</div><div>sean.allday@britishschool.edu.my</div><div><br></div><div>Kat Mcnaughton &amp; Miss Leah</div><div>katherine.mcnaughton@britishschool.edu.my</div><div><br></div><div>Jessica Evans &amp; Mr Dan</div><div>jessica.evans@britishschool.edu.my</div><div><br></div><div>Francesca Wiltshire &amp; Mr Daniel</div><div>francesca.wiltshire@britishschool.edu.my</div></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;"><br></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;"><font size="4"><br></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;"><br></div></div></span></font></div></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif">{!Contact.SchoolText__c}</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><i><font class="Apple-style-span" color="#ff6600"><b>World Class Education</b></font></i></span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif">__________________________________________________________</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="1">{!User.School_List_Email_Footer__c}</font><font class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;" face="Arial, sans-serif" size="1">&nbsp;</font></div>]]></td>
