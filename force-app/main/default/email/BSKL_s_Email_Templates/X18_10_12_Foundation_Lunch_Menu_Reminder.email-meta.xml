Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

This is a gentle reminder to send in the lunch menu (5th Nov â€“ 14th Dec 2012) for your child/children before the deadline Thursday, 25th October 2012 as Friday the 26th is a public holiday. This will assist the canteen staff to organise accordingly.

For those of you who have sent in the menu, kindly ignore this email.

Thank you and have a nice day.

Kind Regards,

Administration Team
