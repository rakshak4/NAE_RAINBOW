Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We are pleased to inform you that your child has been enrolled in the French cookery class which will take place on Saturday 23rd February.

In order to secure the place for your child, please kindly make a payment of 160 RM to the administration office. The deadline for payment is fairly tight - Tuesday 5th February. This is because we need to confirm the cooking class with Nathalie Gourmet Studio promptly.

We will let you know in due course about the details of the class.

We are sure this will be a wonderful experience for our students!

Kind regards,
Blandine Pouchard and Tom Hickman
