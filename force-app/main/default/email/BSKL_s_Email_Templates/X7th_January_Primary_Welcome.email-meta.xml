    <textOnly>Dear Parents,



Please accept my apologies for the last minute postponement of yesterday’s Welcome Meeting. As I hope you can imagine having read Mr Mincher’s email yesterday I was unavoidably detained.



I have rescheduled the second Parent Welcome Meeting for tomorrow afternoon, 7 January from 1.30-2.30.



If you would like to join the link for the meeting, please find the meet link below:

I look forward to seeing many of you there.



Best wishes,



Mr Simon Sharp
