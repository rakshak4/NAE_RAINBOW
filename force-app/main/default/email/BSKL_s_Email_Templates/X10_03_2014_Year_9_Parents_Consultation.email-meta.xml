Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Year 9 Parents&apos; Consultation takes place between 5pm and 7pm on Tuesday 18th March, and we are trialling a new appointment booking system using Google Docs. You will notice that some staff have appointments available from 4.30pm, and some are blocked out until 5.00pm. I would like to give those staff that want to the opportunity to meet from 4.30pm, but many will be involved in ASAs until 4.15pm and will need a break.

Please bear the following in mind when booking an appointment:
1. Click on the link below.
2. Use tabs at bottom to locate subjects and your child&apos;s teacher.
3. Type your child&apos;s name into an available slot.
4. Please do not delete anyone else&apos;s appointments.
5. Once you have typed your child&apos;s name in, the appointment will be saved automatically - you do not have to save anywhere else.
6. Please make a note of your appointments and bring it with you.

Yours sincerely
