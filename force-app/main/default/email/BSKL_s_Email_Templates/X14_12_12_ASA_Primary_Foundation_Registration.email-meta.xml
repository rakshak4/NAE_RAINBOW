Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Below are links for the ASA Foundation &amp; Primary Registration form and the ASA Information Handbooks. Please see the instructions below for completing the forms:

Decide which ASA you would like your children to do from the information provided in the ASA Information Handbook.
Click on the ‘Registration Form’ link below.
Fill out all of the information and click on the drop down box to see all of the ASA’s for the whole week.
Only register your child for one ASA for each of the days you wish them to participate.
You will then receive confirmation via email telling you whether your child has been enrolled or put on the waitlist for that ASA.
If you receive an email saying your child is on the wait list then please submit another registration form with your child’s 2nd choice for that day.
You must submit separate forms for each ASA’s you wish to register your child in. For example if you would like them to do 1 ASA on Tuesday and 1 ASA on Thursday you would have to submit 2 forms, 1 for each ASA.

Please take note of a few key pieces of information regarding ASA’s next term below:

Please note that the “BSKL Team Penang Team Preparation”; “U11 BSKL Team Football”; “U9 BSKL Team Football” &amp; “Penang Pre-competition Training” are invitation only. The teams have been selected from trials last week. Only register your child for one of these ASA’s if they have been selected for the Teams. The Teams lists were sent out on Wednesday evening to all parents so please check if you are unsure.
