Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName}


Reception Curriculum – Term 3



We would like to welcome you and your child to the final term of their Reception Year. Your child has a fun-filled, action packed term ahead of them. This letter will tell you all about the sorts of things that will happen in Reception, so that you can help to prepare your child for their exciting learning journey.



Highlights of last term



Your child had a great second term and has continued to make super progress. Our topics last term included ‘Transport’, ‘Animals’ and ‘Easter’. Children particularly enjoyed using our exciting role play areas (an airport, aeroplane, ferry, pet shop, veterinary surgery and chocolate factory) going to the theatre to see ‘The Snail and The Whale’ and our trip to the Negara Zoo. Thank you to those parents who brought in pets from home as part of our ‘Show and Tell’ sessions.



What happens when?



Swimming and PE lessons remain on the same set days as in Term 2.



On swimming days please send the following named items in a bag: swimming costume, goggles, towel, swimming hat and pool shoes.  On PE days your child can come to school dressed in their PE kit and their trainers.



It’s really important that you name all items of clothing, shoes, water bottles, hats and bags. Everything looks the same so it can be very confusing for the teachers as well as the children!  Please remember that sun hats should be in school at all times and your child should bring a fresh bottle of water with them every day.



Any changes to normal school routines or important dates or events (such as dress up days, concerts, trips etc.) will be shared with you via the school calendar and we encourage parents to check the online Parent Portal calendar regularly.



This term our topic is…



Initially this term we will base our learning around the topic ‘Healthy Eating’. We will start off by providing the children with plenty of opportunities to talk about their favourite foods, which foods they think are healthy and not so healthy, as well as learning about the reasons we need to eat a balanced and varied diet.



Each week the Reception teachers will meet to review the children’s learning and plan for the following week. Our topic will expand according to the children’s interests and you can follow our weekly progress via the Parent Portal class blogs. Tasks will be fun and practical, using both the inside and outside learning environments. The teachers and other adults supporting your child will make sure that the activities are suited to your child’s unique needs.



Phonics



Your child will continue to take part in a phonics lesson every day. Most of the children are now working on consolidating Phase 3 of the ‘Letters and Sounds’ Programme and some will be progressing through Phase 4 this term. We will tell you which letters / sounds / words we are learning each week so that you can help your child to continue their learning at home.



We will build on the writing skills that we developed last term and children will be given a variety of different meaningful writing opportunities, such as lists, letters, stories and factual accounts. They will learn about finger spaces, capital letters and full stops, and will ‘have a go’ at writing a range of common words from memory, as well as tricky words using their phonic skills. If your child is keen to write at home, please ensure they use the correct letter formation.



Children will continue to bring home new reading books each week, with books being changed every Thursday. Please do find time to enjoy the books with your child at home, as well as reading your child’s lists of tricky words together. Developing a love of books at this early age will really help them to develop their writing skills. It is important that your child brings their reading bag to school every day.


What about Mathematics?



Don’t worry there are also plenty of mathematical opportunities. The children will be developing their confidence with number, shape, space and size through practical activities, number rhymes and stories. We will be singing a variety of familiar and new number rhymes to support their understanding of number (sequence), calculations (one more / one less), pattern and measure (height, capacity, weight). Children will consolidate recognising and understanding numbers to 20 and when they are able to do this they will work with larger numbers up to 100. They will learn to count in 2s, 5s and 10s. There will be lots of practical, fun activities to support their understanding of simple number problems, such as how many different ways to make ten. The children will continue to develop their skills for addition and subtraction by using tactile resources and / or number lines.



Modern Foreign Languages (MFL)



Chinese and Spanish language lessons continue this term with vocabulary being linked to the Reception topics.



PE



Children will continue with their swimming lessons in the big pool and will be split into four groups. They will all continue to work at the big pool and will be split into four groups. The children will work on water confidence, streamlining and stroke development. In their other PE lesson, (across the term) they will be introduced to Outdoor and Adventurous Activities (OAA), which will include the children using the bouldering area and some the climbing wall and team building activities. They will also be taught more ‘Games Skills’ to include space awareness games, such as &apos;stuck-in the-mud&apos; and instruction games, such as &apos;The Bean Game.&apos;  They will learn skills to improve their throwing and catching, patting and striking skills, using various different pieces of equipment. They will also try out skill-based activities to include running, relays and obstacle courses in preparation for Sports Day.



Music



Music lessons this term will be supporting all the main class themes which include food and growing and planting. The children will be learning a variety of songs and poems and listening to different types of music related to these themes, with a musical focus on the basic musical elements of pulse, rhythm, pitch and dynamics. This is explored through movement in specific or imaginative ways, exploring our spoken and singing voices, and playing a range of percussion instruments.



Can parents help?



We always welcome donations of junk boxes, bottle tops, cardboard tubes, corks and other things that we can use in our model making areas.



Please speak to your child’s teacher or teaching assistant if you would like to help with listening to the children read on a regular basis.



Events to look forward to include:



Thursday 11th June Primary Open Day

Wednesday 17th June  EYFS Splash Day

Wednesday 24th  June EYFS Sports Day

Wednesday 1st July  EYFS Production and End of Year

Celebration Lunch



Home-time



For safeguarding purposes, can we ask that adults wear their identification tags at all times within school and if your child is due to be collected by someone else, please do inform us in advance.



Stay in touch!



Your views are important to us and we are keen to work in partnership with all parents. Please do contact us if you have a question or any feedback.


We look forward to working with you throughout the term.
