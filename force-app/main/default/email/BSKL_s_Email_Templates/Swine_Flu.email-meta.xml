Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Today I was informed that there has been a confirmed case of H1N1 in Year 3. Due to production rehearsals this child has been in both campuses and mixed closely with Y3&amp;4 children.
Please look out for any of the following symptoms and do not send your child in if they exhibit any of these symptoms.

Fever above 37.5 degrees
Vomiting
Sneezing, cough and runny nose
Severe headaches and aching body
Diarrhea or stomach upset

School will continue to make sure every child uses sanitiser gel and as happens daily in primary that their temperature is taken in the morning.
Cleaners are in Sunday disinfecting the campus. Sodexo and SHF have been informed to ensure they do the same in the kitchens.
Both nurses are aware of the situation and on alert.

Below is further information

Kind regards,
