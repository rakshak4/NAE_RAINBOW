Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

To coincide with World Book Day on Thursday 7 March, there will be a book sale at BSKL on Thursday from 8.30am-4.30pm. Children will be given the opportunity to visit the sale during class and break times. There will be 2 vendors on the day. Roving Books will have books for younger readers up to primary school and books will cost between RM 5-30. Real Books will have books for upper primary to middle school and books will cost between RM 20-50.

Reading has many benefits for children including:
•    bonding time when parents and children read together
•    it fuels imagination and creativity
•    promotes longer attention span
•    helps to improve vocabulary
•    it&apos;s fun and relaxing
Your help in promoting the love of reading to your children is much appreciated. Please buy a book or two, or three!
