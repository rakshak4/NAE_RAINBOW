Getting to the stadium:
Students who normally get the school bus will be dropped off at the stadium, not at school. Other students on the bus who are not involved at sports day will be dropped off at school as normal.

Students who normally get dropped of at school by parents will need to be dropped off at the stadium, not at school.

Students will be registered arrival.

Getting back to school:
There will be transport arranged for all students to get back to school after the event. Normal travel arrangements will be in play after school has finished at 3pm.

Attire:
Students will need to come dressed in their PE shorts, training shoes and house t-shirts. They will need to bring some snacks (as they will have a later lunch), drinks, water bottle and a hat. Sun cream is recommended too.

Kind regards,
