Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName}

Year 6 Curriculum – Term 3



After an active Term 2, with our Ipoh residential trip and rainforest inspired day trip to the Forestry Research Institute of Malaysia (FRIM), another busy and important term awaits as we work towards our Standardised Assessment Tests (SATs) and transition to Secondary School.



As you know, we run a literacy-based thematic curriculum with the children studying a different theme each term. This term, we will be focusing on ‘Transport’ and this will run across many of the subjects we will be teaching in class.



English



We will be looking at Classic and Modern Classic fiction, reading extracts from novels from the ‘Just William’ series by Richard Compton and ‘The Eighteenth Emergency’ by Betsy Byers. In terms of non-fiction, Year Six will be looking at information texts, non-chronological reports and journalistic writing. This will be linked in, where possible, to our topic on Transport. We will continue to use the ‘Talk for Writing’ approach in English, which so far has been hugely successful in enabling the children to imitate the language they need for a particular topic orally before independently applying it into their writing. There will be an emphasis on differentiated Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar (SPaG) activities. Regular guided and shared reading with the children will also continue to improve their comprehension skills and encourage reading for pleasure.



Mathematics



The children will have daily maths lessons ensuring that all aspects of mathematics curriculum are covered. To improve fluency, the children will learn a number of mental maths strategies, applying their knowledge of times tables and corresponding division facts up to 12x12, to find fractions and percentages of amounts and measures, as well as calculation methods for long multiplication and division. Explanations will be a key focus when problem solving.



The children will have the opportunity to look at positive and negative numbers in real life contexts, as well as finding percentages of numbers and converting percentages into fractions and decimals. In ‘Shape, Space and Measure’,  they will look at properties of quadrilaterals and different types of triangles, area and perimeter, interpretation of scales and conversion of metric units. Data handling will include interpretation of bar graphs, line and pie charts, as well as finding the range, mean, median and mode.



Science



This term we will be looking at Animals and Humans. This unit looks at the human circulatory system and the impact of diet, exercise and drugs on their system. We will also be looking at the process of respiration and the impact of nutrients in our blood. Our final topic of the year will be Electricity. Here we will learn about electrical circuits, identifying common conductors and insulators.



Computing



The children will be looking at Google spreadsheets this term and learning how to create them and use the associated formulae. As part of this unit, we will also look at modifying and formatting cells working with functions and sorting and filtering data.



Topic



There will be more of a design and technology focus this term as we look at the history of transport. Building on our historical skills, we will look at how transport has changed over time and how this affects us today. We will be designing and building a model car made from wood and then evaluating these. Our homework project this term will be to make a papier mache hot air balloon. Children will then have the chance to paint and decorate these in class.



Modern Foreign Language (MFL)



Year 6 children will continue studying either Mandarin or Spanish.  Mandarin lessons are differentiated by ability due to the wide range of competency amongst our children. In Term 3, the topics that cover in the Year 6 Chinese curriculum include:



Basic: Food and Beverage, School and Uniform, Stationery and My House.

Beginner: Time and Routines, Food and Beverage, Transportation and Hobbies

Elementary: Fast Food and Desserts, including healthy food, Transportation and Currency

Intermediate: Leisure activities, Culture, Sickness and Health

Advance: Famous people in China, Technology and Entertainment



In Spanish, this term,  the children will be covering a number of short topics including: Animals (farm and wild animals), Vegetables and Fruits, Time, (daily routines), Transport and Summer Festivals in Spain. Throughout the topic work we will be incorporating lots of new vocabulary and using songs, role plays, stories and creative activities to continue to develop the children&apos;s speaking, reading and writing skills in Spanish.



Malaysian children will continue to study Bahasa. They will be looking at Clothes and Musical Instruments.



Music



This term the children will be focusing on: Stars, Hide Your Fires - Performing Together and Who Knows? - Exploring Music Processes.



PE



This term the children will be introduced to Outdoor and Adventurous Activities (OAA), which will include using the climbing wall/bouldering area, team building and orienteering activities.  They will also play football and/ or tag rugby.  Group B PE will get the opportunity to play badminton (as they did volleyball last term) and the other groups will be introduced to volleyball skills.  These activities will be rotated throughout Term 3.



Homework



Spelling homework is slightly different this term as we move closer to the Standardised Assessments Tests (SATs). The homework will be based more towards Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar (SPAG) and will depend on which group your child has been placed in for the SAT’s revision groups. For maths homework, we will be using MyMaths and a range of open-ended Maths activities linked to work carried out in class. Homework will be set on a Wednesday, to be completed by the following Wednesday.



All children now have access to the MyMaths website and should have received a username and password that can be used at home. Spending short, but regular, sessions playing educational Maths games will help consolidate learning and also give opportunities to develop new mathematical skills.



Assessment



We are looking forward to this year’s SATs that start the week beginning the 15th of June. The children will be sitting tests for the whole week and in between this we will be continuing with our normal timetables.



Events to look forward to include:



Monday,  18th May  Year 5 &amp; 6 Sports Day

Thursday 11th May Primary Open Day

Friday, 12th June  KS2 Parent’s ‘Coffee and Chat’

Monday 15th June Start of Year 6 SAT’s week

Friday, 3rd July  Year 6 Leavers’ Assembly



Each Year 6 class will continue to share with you what has been happening in class via the class Parent Portal blogs. Any changes to normal school routine or important dates or events will be shared with you via the school calendar and we encourage parents to check the Parent Portal calendar regularly.



For safeguarding purposes, can we ask that adults wear their identification tags at all times within school and if your child is due to be collected by someone else, please do inform us in advance.



I hope this letter gives you a brief insight into what your child will be learning this term. As always, if you have any questions or concerns please contact your class teacher as a first point of contact.



Kind regards,



The Year 6 Team
