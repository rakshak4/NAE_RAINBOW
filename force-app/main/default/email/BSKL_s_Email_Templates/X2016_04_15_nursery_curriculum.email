<p class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">We would like to welcome you and your child to the final term of their year. Your child has a fun-filled, action packed term ahead of them. This letter will tell you all about the sorts of things that will happen in Nursery, so that you can help to prepare your child for their exciting learning journey.</span></p><p class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b style="font-size: 12pt;"><font color="#3366ff">Highlights of last term&nbsp;</font></b></p><p class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Last term, the Nursery children showed a lot of enthusiasm towards our topic on ‘Our World’. We carried out experiments and research to extend our knowledge and had fun finding out new ways of doing things. We really enjoyed watching the production of ‘The Owl Who was Afraid of the Dark’, and the Year Two production as well.&nbsp; The children loved dressing up during our ‘Novel idea’s week’, and shared their favourite stories with confidence.&nbsp; In the early part of the term, we celebrated Chinese New Year and had another opportunity to dress up and try new foods and hear about different cultural celebrations.</span></p><p class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b style="font-size: 12pt;"><font color="#3366ff">What happens when?</font></b></p><p class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Swimming is still on Monday, but we are now using the big pool every week.&nbsp; Please remember to send your child in with a pair of shoes that they can easily walk in and are appropriate for going to the pool in. The school poncho style towel which is now available would also be very useful as we do need to walk between the two sites using the stairs.</span></p><p class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></p><ul style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Our soft start time is 7:45 – 8:30am every day. During this time you will be able to join your child in their classroom to ‘stay and play’. The register will be taken at 8:30am, so please do ensure that your child is present by that time.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On <b>swimming days </b>(Monday) please send the following named items in a bag: swimming costume, towel, swimming hat and easy to put on and remove pool shoes. Please send your child to school on Mondays wearing their PE kit and trainers.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On <b>PE days </b>(Friday) your child can also come to school dressed in their PE kit and their trainers.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It’s really important that you name all items of clothing, shoes, water bottles, hats and bags. A complete spare change of uniform, including socks and underwear should be left in a named bag in your child’s locker every day, in case of little accidents.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Please remember that sun hats should be in school at all times and your child should bring a fresh bottle of water with them everyday.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp; </span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">A healthy afternoon snack is also required (no nuts or nut products please).</span></li></ul><b style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial;"><font color="#3366ff">How will your child be learning this term?</font></b><br><p class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">This final term will be a very busy one for the Nursery children. Towards the end of term they will be preparing for another fantastic production, sports day and a fun splash day too.&nbsp; As in the previous terms, we are enabling the children to direct their learning by the interests that they express and we are very excited to see what amazing ideas they come up with.&nbsp; As always we support the children’s interests with exciting creative ideas and stories and activities to develop their knowledge and understanding. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The Nursery teachers meet regularly to review the children’s learning and plan for the following activities. We may add to topics that the children have initiated and expand it in ways the children have not considered making learning opportunities more&nbsp; varied and adventurous. You can follow our weekly progress via the Parent Portal. Tasks will be fun and practical, using both the inside and outside learning environments. The teachers and other adults supporting your child will make sure that the activities are suited to your child’s unique needs. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">In the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) children learn by playing and exploring, being active, and through creative and critical thinking which takes place both indoors and outside. In Nursery, our learning environment is organised into different areas, with children being able to move freely between them and the shared space outside the classrooms at certain times of the day. Throughout each day the children are engaged in a balance of teacher-led focus activities and child-initiated activities where they are supported by the staff.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b style="font-size: 12pt;"><font color="#3366ff">Phonics</font></b></p><p class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Your child will continue to take part in a phonics lesson every day; we be developing our knowledge of rhyme, alliteration, phonic sounds; which includes word building and writing the sound, and vocabulary. We will be extending the activities for your child’s individual needs and abilities. Developing speaking, understanding and listening skills are a very important part of our daily activities.</span></p><p class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b style="font-size: 12pt;"><font color="#3366ff">What about mathematics?</font></b></p><p class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">The children will continue developing their confidence with number, shape, space and size through practical activities, number rhymes and stories. We will be singing a variety of familiar and new number rhymes to support their understanding of number (sequence), calculations (one more / one less). There will be lots of practical and fun activities to support their understanding of number. This term we will be focusing on measurement and counting back from ten as well as continuing to strengthen the other skills that have already been introduced.</span></p><p class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b style="font-size: 12pt;"><font color="#3366ff">Modern Foreign Languages (MFL)</font></b></p><p class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Chinese and Spanish language lessons take place four days a week, with learning being linked to the Nursery topics and the children’s interests. The Modern Foreign Language teachers will often use both the inside and outside spaces in the same way that the Nursery teachers do, with children being able to continue their learning through play in Mandarin or Spanish.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b style="font-size: 12pt;"><font color="#3366ff">Can parents help?</font></b></p><p class="p2" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1"></span></p><p class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></p><ul style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We always welcome donations of small junk boxes, bottle tops, jar lids, cardboard tubes, corks, scrap materials and other things that we can use in our model making areas.</span></li><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Please log into the Parent Portal at least once a week to keep up to date with school news, events and to see lots of lovely photos and videos of the children ‘in action’.</span></li></ul><b style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial;"><font color="#3366ff">Home-time</font></b><br><p class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></p><ul style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><li><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial;">The Nursery home time is 2:30pm Monday to Thursday and 2pm on a Friday.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial;">&nbsp; </span><font face="arial" style="font-size: 12pt;">A&nbsp;</font><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="4">crèche</font></span><font face="arial" style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;is provided for children with older siblings in the&nbsp;school; children must be collected at 3:15pm.</font></li><li style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">To ensure the safety of all children, adults are required to wear their identification tags at all times within school.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></li><li style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">If your child is due to be collected by someone else please do inform us in advance.</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12pt;">&nbsp;</span></li></ul><b style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial;"><font color="#3366ff">Illness</font></b><br><p class="p1" style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Please remember that if your child has had sickness or diarrhoea, then they are not to attend school for 48 hours after the last bout.
