Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Welcome to the British International School of Kuala Lumpur.

In this Welcome Letter, you will find some important information regarding your child’s school life.

The school is keen to ensure a smooth transition; on your child’s first physical day at school, they will be met by their teacher, who will take them to their class. They will be given a class ‘buddy’ who will help and support them in their first few weeks as they become familiar with school routines. You can read how we support new students academically and socially, to ensure they have the best start to their school life at BSKL.

Please find below further information on key areas, such as uniforms, the parent app and sports club sign ups and more.

We are looking forward to welcoming you all into the BSKL family. We wish you a pleasant beginning to your time with us and our teachers look forward to meeting you in person.

Best wishes,
Secondary School Leadership Team
The British International School of Kuala Lumpur

Term 2 Start
The first day of the new term will be 4 January 2021. We hope to be opening campus physically, but we will plan for both an in-person and virtual start depending upon the status of the Conditional Movement Control Order (CMCO). The Admissions team will keep you updated about our start of term plans.

School Uniforms
All children will be expected to be in school uniform when in-person classes resume. You can review the secondary school student uniform guidelines on our website. The uniform shop will open on Monday 28 December from 9.30am to 4pm. They will be open Monday through Thursday that week, by appointment. They will resume normal operations on Monday 4 January.

The uniform shop is located at the Upper Hill Campus. Upon arrival, please report to Front Desk initially who will guide you where to go. Strict SOPs from the Malaysian government will be in place, including the need for all guests to complete the Travel and Health Declaration form and scan the MySejahtera QR Code upon arrival. Masks should be worn and social distancing in place within the store.

Please contact Mr Steven at steven@l-vince.com if you have any questions regarding the uniform shop or refer to the school&apos;s website.

The uniform shop has an online store where you can place uniform orders and collect them in the shop, but we recommend you buy in-shop the first time to ensure sizing is correct.

Parent ID tag
You will be provided a parent ID tag and a car sticker to allow your entrance into the school. Please note that a current school ID tag must be worn at all times while in school.

If you haven&apos;t already please send a passport-size photo to admissions@britishschool.edu.my for your ID. You will be able to collect your ID from the Lower Hill Campus Front Desk, when you come to purchase/pick up your uniform if you&apos;ve submitted your photo in advance.

Secondary Parent Handbook
The Secondary Parent Handbook 2020 can be found on our website and is via this link, for ease of access.

Bus Information
In order to book a seat, please see our bus routes on our web page and reach out to the contact stated. Please note that places are dependent on availability. The bus service will commence when classes resume on campus.

BSKL Parent App
The BSKL Parent App is a smart phone app to provide parents with an &apos;in the palm of your hand&apos; bespoke communication tool.

Each parent/guardian can have access to the App, by simply downloading it from the relevant store (search for BSKL Parent App). To register for the App, please follow the instructions in this document.

For any questions relating to the app, please contact the Parent App Liaison Officer, at portal@britishschool.edu.my

Private Music Lessons
In addition to the Music Curriculum which consists of whole-class music and Group Instrumental Lessons (PIPs and SIPs), BSKL supports a diverse Individual Instrumental Programme for students in Year 2 and above. These lessons are focused on encouraging students who have a particular enjoyment of playing music, to develop their interests and studies further. More information on the programme can be found on our website here. Registration for the programme opens before the start of each term.

Visit the New Family section of our website for more information about joining BSKL.
