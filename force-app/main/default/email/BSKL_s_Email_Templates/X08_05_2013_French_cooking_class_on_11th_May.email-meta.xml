Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We would like to remind you that the French cooking class is this Saturday, 11th May.

The bus will depart from school at 8.30 am. To ensure we can leave on time, would you please make sure your child is in school no later than 8.15.

There is no need for your child to bring anything, as water will be provided at the studio.

We are once again looking forward to sharing this wonderful experience with our students !

Yours faithfully

Blandine Pouchard and Tom Hickman


Regards,
Administration Team
