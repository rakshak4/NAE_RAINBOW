Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

The lunch menu for Term 3 is now due.

We would very much appreciate if you could email them to Sabrina at bskl.service@britishschool.edu.my or hand them in at either school reception by Friday 18th April 2014 so that we can make the necessary arrangements before start of Term 3.

Please follow the link below for the menu:

Thank you for your support and cooperation.


Kind regards
