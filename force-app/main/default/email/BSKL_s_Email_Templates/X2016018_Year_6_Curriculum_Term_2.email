We can now look forward to a busy term two that includes our Year 6 residential visit to Langkawi.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>At BSKL, we run a literacy-based thematic curriculum, which we hope will really engage the children in their learning. Our main theme this term is Volcanoes and Earthquakes.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>English</b></div><div>In English this term, we will be focusing the use of commas, clauses, pronouns and adverbials in our grammar lessons. During writing, we will be planning and composing a UFO diary as a recount, writing a flashback in the present tense and looking at techniques involved with persuasive writing. Along with this, reading comprehension will play an important part of the curriculum in term two with the children focusing on inferential based questions and including evidence from the text in their answers.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Mathematics</b></div><div>The children will have five hours of mathematics lessons each week, ensuring that all aspects of the mathematics curriculum are covered. We will be using the new Mathematics Mastery approach to ensure that the children achieve a deep understanding of the concepts they are learning. We will be focusing this term on missing angles and unknown angles in shape and classifying shapes based on their properties. We will then be looking at long division and multiplication involving decimals. This will have a focus on problem solving and using the four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) to solve multi-step problems.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Science</b></div><div>In science, we will be looking at ‘Electricity’ and ‘Animals, including Humans’. This will involve drawing circuits and understanding why circuits are broken. We will also be looking at the symbols used and then building simple and parallel circuits. Using ‘circuit scribe’, a brand new resource, &nbsp;the children will be able to experiment with a variety of materials and resources designed to encourage problem solving activities through the use of electricity. For our unit on ‘Animals, including Humans’, we will be looking at classifications and the five kingdoms that living things are grouped into. The role of bacteria and micro-organisms will also be studied and then how we can use databases to identify living things.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Integrated Curriculum (Topic)</b></div><div>Our topic this term is Volcanoes and Earthquakes. We will be identifying and describing how physical features affect human activity within a location. We will explore natural disasters and the effect these have on people and the wider communities. After this, we will focus on plate tectonics and how earthquakes are formed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In Design and Technology (DT), we are going to design and make small scale models of buildings that are designed to withstand earthquakes. In Art we will be painting volcanoes in the style of Vincent van Gogh.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Computing</b></div><div>In computing, the children will be looking at podcasting and using google spreadsheets. The children will have the opportunity to record short sessions of themselves on a subject of their choice. They can then edit this work before sharing their finished articles with their classmates. With google spreadsheets they will be learning how to input basic formulas as well more complex skills associated with google sheets.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Physical Education (PE)</b></div><div>In PE, Year 6 children will have two one-hour PE lessons (Mondays and Wednesdays) and one separate swimming lesson (Thursdays). On their swimming lesson day, they will come in their school uniform, not PE kit. &nbsp;On their PE days, they will come in PE kit and remain in it for the whole day. In their PE lessons, over the course of Term 2 and the start of Term 3, they will take part in the following activities: &nbsp;football, athletics, T-Ball, unihoc, badminton and dance. &nbsp;These activities will be rotated throughout the term, so that all groups take part in all activities. The children will continue to be grouped by ability and will be assessed throughout the term, in order that we can move pupils accordingly. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Modern Foreign Languages (MFL)</b></div><div>Year 6 children have the option to study either Mandarin or Spanish. Both Mandarin and Spanish &nbsp;lessons are differentiated by ability due to the range of competency amongst our children.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Chinese: In Term 2, the Mandarin lessons for the beginner group will be covering the topics of “Chinese Zodiac”, “Birthdays” and “Days of the week and Months”. Elementary level will be covering the topics of “Friends”, “Appearance and description” and “Clothing”. Intermediate level will be covering the topics of “School Facilities” and “Imperative Sentences”. Advanced level will be focusing on the passage, “Ta Men Zheng Zai Shui Jiao Ne” (They are Sleeping) and “Chong Ming De Gong Ji” (The Clever Rooster). All levels will continue to develop children's listening, speaking, reading and writing skills. Besides that, children will also be learning about Chinese New Year traditions and culture in Term 2.</div><div><br></div><div>In Spanish, the children are also grouped. Each group will be covering a number of short topics including:- the weather, forecasts and seasons revision; family (including descriptions), ‘Where I Live’, my house and my bedroom; my daily routine, hobbies and sport and, finally, shopping at the cafe.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Music</b></div><div>This term in music the children will be looking at the following themes: Journey Into Space - exploring sound sources and Songwriter - exploring lyrics and melody.</div><div><br></div><div>This topic will delve into the world of songwriting. It will explore the key features in lyrics, melody and accompaniment typical to different types of songs, including blues and the gamelan. The children will comment on and analyse different styles of music before composing their own songs.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Homework</b></div><div>In Year 6, we encourage more independent work in preparation for the transition to secondary school. Children will be given two weekly 40-minute homework tasks linked to literacy (including topic) work or mathematics from their class teacher, as well as specialist homework for Modern Foreign Languages. Spelling homework, comprising sentence work or investigations, must be handed in on a Friday. For maths homework, we will be using Mymaths and a range of mathematics activities complementing the work carried out in class. This will be set on a Wednesday, to be completed by the following Wednesday. The homework for topic this term will be for the children to make a PowerPoint or slide presentation about one particular volcano or earthquake and then to present it at the end of the term. The children will also receive weekly homework from their Modern Foreign Language (MFL) – Spanish, Mandarin or Bahasa class.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Communication</b></div><div>Each Year 6 class will continue to share with you what is happening in class via the class portal blogs. Any changes to normal school routine or important dates/events will be shared via the school calendar. Although a notification e-mail may be sent, we encourage parents to check the Parent Portal calendar regularly.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>For safeguarding purposes, we ask that adults wear their identification tags at all times within school and if your child is due to be collected by someone else, please do inform us in advance.</div><div><br></div><div>We hope you find this information useful and I am sure that this is going to be a very positive and productive Year 6. As always, if you have any questions or concerns please contact your class teacher as a first point of contact.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Kind regards,&nbsp;</div><div><b>Year 6 Team</b></div><div><b><br></b></div><div>Craig Moore (Year 6 leader) &amp; Ms Alison Lazenby &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>craig.moore@britishschool.edu.my</div><div><br></div><div>James Dallas &amp; Ms Abbie O’Neill &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div>james.dallas@britishschool.edu.my</div><div><br></div><div>Kayleigh Smith &amp; Mr Phil Leaman &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>kayleigh.smith@britishschool.edu.my</div><div><br></div><div>Tom Kimber &amp; Ms Imogen Allan &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>thomas.kimber@britishschool.edu.my</div><div><br></div><div>Jessica Weaire &amp; Mr Michael Bradley &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;jessica.weaire@britishschool.edu.my</div></div></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;"><br></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;"><br></div></div></span></font></div></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif">{!Contact.SchoolText__c}</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><i><font class="Apple-style-span" color="#ff6600"><b>World Class Education</b></font></i></span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif">__________________________________________________________</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="1">{!User.School_List_Email_Footer__c}</font><font class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;" face="Arial, sans-serif" size="1">&nbsp;</font></div>]]></td>
