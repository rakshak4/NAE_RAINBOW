Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We recently offered a chance for you to come into school and talk to a visiting doctor about the HPV vaccine. This is something the school feels is very important and we are now in a position to offer the vaccine to you.

After consideration it has been decided that the school will offer Gardasil to pupils and parents alike. Gardasil is the most comprehensive vaccine on the market as it covers 4 strains of the Human Papilloma Virus. The date of the first dose will be 10th of June 2013 and the second dose will be 10th of July with the third following in November(dates will be advised later).

You can choose to have only the first two injections if you are moving schools or countries at the end of the year. If you have already had any one of the doses then you can choose to have the remaining injections.

The vaccine will be administered in school by the Tropicana medical staff, which will include a physician. All vaccines will be administered in the morning in the Nurseâ€™s room and a strict timetable will have to be adhered to as the vaccines have a short shelf life out of storage. If you are unable to attend your appointment please let us know the day before as the payment you will make is non-refundable and you would have to arrange for another appointment at Tropicana Medical Centre as a replacement.

Please find the links to the pupil and adult forms below, payment for the doses is required when you return the forms to school no later than the 4th of June.
