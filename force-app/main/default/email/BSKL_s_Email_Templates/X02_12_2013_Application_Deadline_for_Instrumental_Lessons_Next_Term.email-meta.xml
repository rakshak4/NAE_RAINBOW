The end of the term is fast approaching.

Applications after this date will not be processed. The link to download the Parents&apos; General Information, Policy and Agreement document can be found below.

Link to application document: Parents&apos; General Information, Policy and Agreement (http://www.britishschool.edu.my/media/315667/parents_instrumental_lessons_agreement.pdf)

For new parents who wish for their children to start individual instrumental lessons, please download the same document above and complete the online application process.

All applications should be emailed to instrumental.music@britishschool.edu.my and not submitted to primary or secondary campus receptions.

It&apos;s been a fabulous term for instrumental music with many assembly and reception foyer performances. Our programme continues to grow and we hope we will see you all again next year.

Happy Christmas.
