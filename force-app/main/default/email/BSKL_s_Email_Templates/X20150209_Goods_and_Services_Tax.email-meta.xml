Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName}

On 1 April 2015 the Malaysian Government is introducing a 6% Goods and Services Tax (GST) on a wide range of goods and services. Most of the services BSKL provides are GST exempt. However, as from 1st April BSKL must collect the 6% GST on Uniforms, Enrichment Activities and Instrumental Programme Lessons.

The GST introduction also impacts the way we can take payment for School Uniform. As from 23rd February we will ask parents to pay at the uniform shop with Cash, Cheque and Credit Card. We will not be able to accept payment via bank transfer.

Please let me know if you require further information.

Best regards,
Emma Cleary
