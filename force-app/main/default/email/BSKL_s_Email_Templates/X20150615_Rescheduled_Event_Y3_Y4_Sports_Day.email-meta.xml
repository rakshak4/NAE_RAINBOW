Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Rescheduled event - Year 3 and 4 Sports Day



We have decided to continue with the rest of the Year 3 and 4 Sports Day tomorrow, Tuesday 16th June. The event will commence at 8.30am just as it did today.



Thank you for your support today; the children were really enjoying their events before the rain set in.



I look forward to seeing many of you at the New Camp sports facility tomorrow.



Kind regards,

Mrs. Alison Mackey

Deputy Head of Primary
