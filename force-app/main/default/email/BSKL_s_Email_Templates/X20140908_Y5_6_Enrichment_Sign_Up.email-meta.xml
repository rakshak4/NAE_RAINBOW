The majority of activities are free but there are a few which have a cost attached. Students can sign up for these using the online form, but full payment must be made to the Finance department at BSKL (Primary Campus) before we can guarantee your child&apos;s place in that activity. This must be done before Wednesday September 17th - the first day of enrichment activities.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the Primary Enrichment Coordinator, Punitha Ganesan at punitha.ganesan@britishschool.edu.my
