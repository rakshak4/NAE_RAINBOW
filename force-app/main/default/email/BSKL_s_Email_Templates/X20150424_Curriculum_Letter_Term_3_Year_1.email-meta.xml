Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName}



Year 1 Curriculum – Term 3


Welcome back once again! We hope you have managed to have a restful break with your families. The purpose of this letter is to provide you with some information about what your children will be enjoying in Year 1 this term, as well as to update you on forthcoming events.

We are looking forward to another fun and busy term; the Year 1 team have chosen some very exciting topics for your children: ‘Dinosaurs’ followed by ‘Superheroes’. We will be focusing on a variety of stories and informative non-fiction texts related to these themes to truly immerse ourselves into these two fantastic worlds. All subjects will be linked, as much as possible, so that our learning is all encompassing and, as always, enjoyable.

English

We will be sharing a selection of stories related to our ‘Dinosaurs’ and ‘Superheroes’ themes. When studying dinosaurs, we will use non-fiction texts, including encyclopaedias, to learn about the history of dinosaurs and features of many of these incredible creatures. Poetry will also be linked to our Dinosaur topic and we will be learning some poems using body actions to remember important vocabulary.  We will also learn to create some acrostic and shape poems. Later in the term, we will be finding out about some of our favourite superheroes and use all this information to enter a fantasy world where we will become authors and write our own ‘Superhero’ adventures.

Mathematics

This term we will be working with number, counting forwards and backwards and understanding that numbers are constructed with tens and ones. This notion helps children have a solid base and understanding of numbers, which will in turn, help them throughout their numerical learning paths.  We will learn more about measuring and comparing various objects and amounts (size, capacity, weight, etc). Learning strategies for calculating addition and subtraction problems will also continue to be a large part of the children’s learning. Multiplication and division will be introduced in more detail this term, by learning about sharing and grouping objects to make ‘lots’ or ‘groups’ of objects. Children will begin to understand how to divide equally and that this can be done through sharing into equal parts or making equal groups. Finally, we will revise shapes, recognising and understanding a variety of 2D and 3D shapes (sphere, cube, cuboid, pyramid, cylinder).

Topic

Topic sessions will include both history and geography. In geography, children will be learning to name, locate and identify countries and seas that surround Malaysia.  In history, we will learn to create timelines through our dinosaur theme. Our art and design technology (DT) for the term will include a selection of activities. Children will have the opportunity make dinosaur skeletons with straws. They will get to be archaeologists, discovering dinosaur bones and putting them back together to create their own dinosaur with moving parts.  In art, we will also be drawing superheroes in action, using our observational skills to show different superhero poses.

Science

Our science topic will continue to be based around ‘Living Things’.  The children will learn about birds and reptiles, looking at their body parts and differences.  They will group different animals by looking at different characteristics and begin to compare these to human beings. When learning about ‘Superheroes’ we will focus on body parts and the importance of being healthy.

Music

What&apos;s the score? - Exploring instruments and symbols

In this topic, children will be learning to recognise different ways sounds are made and changed. They will also be learning how to name, and know how to play, a variety of classroom instruments. This will build to a class performance in which the children will be creating a &apos;graphic&apos; score with their own choice of symbols to represent their chosen instrumental sounds.

Rain, rain, go away - Exploring timbre, tempo and dynamics

In this topic, children will be learning to recognise how sounds and instruments can be used expressively and combined to create music in response to a stimulus. They will be asked to choose carefully and order sounds within simple structures, with a particular focus on timbre, tempo and dynamics.

PE

In PE, the Year 1 children will continue with their swimming lessons on the same day that they had it in Term 2.  In their other two lessons, they will be introduced to Outdoor and Adventurous Activities (OAA), which will include using the climbing wall/bouldering area, and team building activities.  They will also be taught athletic skills to include running, jumping, throwing and skill based activities in preparation for Sports Day.  Later in the term, they will get the opportunity to try out some of their dance moves.

MFL

This term Mandarin lessons will be covering the following topics: Colours, Animals, Pinyin and writing using basic strokes. Learning a wider range of vocabulary and writing descriptions of characters will extend the heritage group further.
In Spanish, the children will be covering a number of short topics including: personal descriptions, reviewing the colours and body parts,  Pets, Food, The Beach, Summer and Sea Animals. Throughout the topic work, we will be incorporating lots of new vocabulary and using songs, role play, stories and creative activities to continue to develop the children&apos;s speaking, reading and writing skills in Spanish. We will also continue to look at Spanish phonics.

Computing

Children will be taught to use technology safely and respectfully, recognising common uses of information technology. They will begin to use logical reasoning to predict and understand the behaviour of simple programs.

Furthermore, they will develop and test key computer and keyboard skills, including the writing of capital letters and printing work.

Homework

Children will continue to be given a weekly literacy activity (e.g. phonics/spelling) and sometimes a mathematics task of approximately 15 minutes. There may also be weeks where teachers decide that a topic activity would be more beneficial.

Following feedback, home readers will no longer be sent in set packs, however, the children will still receive two books to take home each Friday which should be returned the following Thursday. Please continue reading with your child every day. This time is invaluable and enhances children’s language skills. Whilst reading, it is essential to encourage discussion and ask your child questions about the texts, e.g. Who is the main character? What happens when …? Where does the story take place? What do you think could happen next? Can you retell the story? How would you end this story if you could change it? Any questions that instigate discussion are good questions!

All children now have access to Education City, which is an excellent child-friendly resource and will allow your child to complete homework tasks set by the teachers, related to the learning that has taken place in the classroom. The children will also have free access to a very wide range of activities on this website, which they are free to choose from and complete. Teachers will be able to see the activities that have been completed. Most weeks of Term 3 there will be a set task to be completed.

Events to look forward to include:

Monday 28th April  Year 1 visit to Dinoscovery
Wednesday,  6th May  Year 1 and 2 Sports Day
Friday 8th May  KS1 Parents ‘Coffee and Chat’
Friday 15th May  1A Class Performance
Thursday 11th June Primary Open Day
Friday 12th June  1C Class Performance

Each Year 1 class will continue to share with you what has been happening in class via the class Parent Portal blogs. Any changes to normal school routine or important dates or events will be shared with you via the school calendar and we encourage parents to access the Parent Portal regularly.

Just a reminder that, for safeguarding purposes, all adults must wear their identification tags at all times within school and if your child is due to be collected by someone else, please do inform us in advance.

I hope this letter gives you a brief insight into what your child will be learning this term. As always, if you have any questions or concerns please contact your class teacher as a first point of contact.

Kind regards,
Year 1 Team
