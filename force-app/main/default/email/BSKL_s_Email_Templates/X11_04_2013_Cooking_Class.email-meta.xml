Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Following the success of the last visit, the French department would like to organise another cooking class for our students from Year 7 and Year 8 in Nathalie&apos;s Gourmet Studio, in Solaris Dutamas.

Nathalie Arbefeuille is a well-known chef in Kuala Lumpur. She owns a studio and gives cooking classes for small groups. In 2011, she was voted outstanding chef of the year by Time Out KL.

We believe that attending a cooking class in her studio would be a great opportunity for our pupils to learn more about French cuisine and French culture.

The class would involve preparing and cooking a three course meal which the students would then eat afterwards.

The school will organise transportation for the pupils from BSKL to the studio and back to BSKL.

Please, find below the details of the class:

Date : Saturday 11th May
Time : 9 am to 1 pm (all pupils to be in school at 8.30)
Location : Nathalie gourmet studio- Solaris Dutamas
Transportation : bus from BSKL to the studio, back to BSKL.
Number of students : 12
Year group : 7 and 8
Price per student : 160 RM

The studio can only give classes for a maximum of 12 students. Although we do already have a waiting list from the last visit for those who couldnâ€™t go, please indicate to us again if you would still like your child to attend.

To ensure a place for your child, please send an email at the address below as soon as possible, and no later than Friday 19th April. You will be asked to make full payment to the school upon confirmation of a place for your child.
