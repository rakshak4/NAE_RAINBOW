Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Next week are our Parent Teacher interviews. They will take place on the Tuesday 26th and Wednesday 27th of November at 3.30pm until 6.00pm.

This term we are asking you to email your child&apos;s teacher with a time that is convenient for you so you may discuss your childs academic and social progress.  You may choose any time in 15 minute intervals from 3.30pm either day.
So you may choose 3.30, 3.45, 4.00, 4.15, 4.30 etc   through to 6.00pm (that being the last appointment).

For example:
Dear Mr Townend,
I wish to make an appointment with you for a parent teacher interview on the 26th of November at 3.45pm to discuss Lydia&apos;s progress. I also wish to make an appointment to see her PE teacher.

You may just want to cut and paste the above statement inserting your preferred date, time and the name of your child.

Specialist teachers such as PE, Chinese, Bahasa and Music will be available in the Primary Gym. Please indicate when replying if you wish to make an appointment to see any of them. Your child&apos;s teacher will pass this onto them and they will reply to you confirming times.

If you have more than one child in KS1 and 2 then please only email the eldest child&apos;s teacher with your preferred appointment times for all of your children. They will then pass this onto the other teacher to avoid conflicts of appointment times.

Your teacher will email you back before the end of this week to confirm your appointment time. If more than one person requires the same time on the same day then the first reply will be allocated that time and the others will be put as close as possible to the preferred time.

Your children&apos;s teachers look forward to seeing you to discuss your child&apos;s progress.

Kind regards,

Lizzie Bottomley &amp; Jeremy Townend
Head of Key Stage 1 and 2
