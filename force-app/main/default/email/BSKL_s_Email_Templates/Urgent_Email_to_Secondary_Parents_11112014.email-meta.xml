Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName}

Please note that the Head of Secondary Forum originally scheduled for tomorrow (12 November) has been put back until 26 November. We changed this date in our calendar on 8 October but I understand some parents still have it showing in their parent portal: this is an error and we are working on this technical issue.

I apologise for any inconvenience and look forward to meeting with you on Wednesday 26 November when we will be holding a parent workshop on study skills.

Kind regards

Derek Mackey
Head of Secondary
