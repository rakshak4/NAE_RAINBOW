Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We would like to thank you for your interest in the French cooking class. Unfortunately, your child couldn&apos;t be enrolled this time as the list was complete by the time your email arrived in school.

Nevertheless, since this class has proven very popular, we would be pleased to run it again later on this year. We have therefore registered your child on a waiting list. Should we run this course again during the Summer term, your child will be given priority.

Yours faithfully,
Blandine Pouchard and Tom Hickman
