Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName}

Year 2 Curriculum – Term 3



Welcome to a new term in Year 2, where we are looking forward to continuing to build on the creative, literacy based curriculum we have enjoyed so far this year.



Last term the children thoroughly enjoyed our ‘Paws, Claws and Jaws’ topic and we were very pleased to see such creativity and imagination both in class and for homework.  We know a lot of effort and time was put in, by both the children and the parents, and we would like to thank you for your support.



Term three will be equally fun-filled, with new and exciting topics.  Our main topic will be ‘Islands’.  Through this topic we will focus on English, science, geography and history, art and design technology.  We will endeavour to include as many subjects as possible in our topic to ensure the children are engaged in their learning.



English



This term we will be reading island themed stories and information texts, including the well known Katie Morag stories by Mairi Hedderwick and the classic tales of the ‘Lighthouse Keeper and his Lunch’ by Ronda and David Armitage. We will also be learning how to write character descriptions, creative stories and information texts.



Phonics is differentiated according children&apos;s knowledge and individual needs. Each group will focus on teaching a particular set of sounds, following the phases set out in Letters and Sounds, in a fun and interactive way to ensure the children are learning and applying their skills at their own pace,  in a more dynamic and targeted way.



Mathematics



The children will have daily maths lessons ensuring that all aspects of mathematics curriculum are covered during the year.  This term they will learning written and mental methods to solve calculations involving the four number operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) using 2-digit and 3-digit numbers.  We will be revisiting how to tell the time and collection and interpretation of data using charts and tables, as well as  learning about symmetry and direction in shapes.  Opportunities to apply these skills with be integrated through lots of maths problem solving.



Science



This term the focus is on Plants and Sound.  Children will learn how to observe and describe seeds and how they grow into mature plants, and investigate how plants need water, light and a suitable temperature to grow and stay healthy. As part of the unit on Sound, the children will have the opportunity to observe and name a variety of sources of sound and recognise that sounds get fainter as the distance from the sound source increases.



Computing



We will be continuing to work on E-Safety and Animation will be our key focus. The children will be using apps to capture images and use these to create and make their own films. During the process they will have opportunities to edit their frames and add effects, including; music, filters and adjusting the speed to experiment and develop their filmmaking skills.



Topic



Topic sessions, will be incorporating elements of geography and history and the children will be learning about the features of islands, how they compare to cities and significant people linked to islands.  Within art, we will study the work of Matisse and create work in his style. We will also be learning about moving mechanisms and building things with moving parts in design technology (DT).



MFL



Year 2 children will continue studying either Mandarin or Spanish.  Mandarin lessons are differentiated by ability due to the wide range of competency amongst our children.  This term Mandarin lessons will be covering the following topics:  Food and Beverage, School (uniform), Stationery and My House.  The heritage group will be extended further by learning a wider range of vocabulary and writing descriptions of characters.



In Spanish, the children will be covering a number of short topics including: - personal descriptions whilst reviewing the colours and body parts,  Pets, Food, The Beach, Summer and Sea Animals. Throughout the topic work,  the children will be learning lots of new vocabulary and using song, role play, stories and creative activities to continue to develop the children&apos;s speaking, reading and writing skills in Spanish. They will also continue to look at Spanish phonics.



In Bahasa, the children will be learning new vocabulary based around the topics: My Family and Shape.



Music



As the children continue with their Primary Instrumental Programme (PIPs), they are developing their string instrument skills.  Music specialists will teach the children once a week and will be incorporating our Islands theme, wherever possible.  Music will also be used to practise and rehearse the songs for our production this term.



PE



In PE, the Year 2 children will continue with their swimming lessons on the same day that they had it in Term 2.  In their other two lessons, they will be introduced to Outdoor and Adventurous Activities (OAA), which will include using the climbing wall/bouldering area, and team building activities.  They will also be taught athletic skills to include running, jumping, throwing and skill based activities in preparation for Sports Day.  Later in the term, they will get the opportunity to try out some of their dance moves.



Homework



Children will be given Maths and English homework on a Monday to be returned by Friday.  Occasionally, this will be replaced by a topic/science research project which may have a longer deadline.  We will keep you informed as and when this type of homework is set.  Year 2 will receive their spellings on a Tuesday and will be assessed the following Monday.



Following feedback, home readers will no longer be sent in set packs, however, the children will still receive two books to take home each Friday which should be returned the following Thursday. We encourage daily reading at home. Sharing thoughts and opinions about the books they have read encourages interest and enthusiasm for books.  Whilst reading please ask your children questions.  For example: Who is the main character? What happens when…? Where does the story take place? What might happen next? Can you retell the story? This will also support the children’s understanding and support their comprehension skills.



Children can choose extra books from the library at any time during the week and classes will continue to have their regular, weekly library session.



All children now have access to the MyMaths website. Spending short, but regular, sessions playing educational maths games will help consolidate learning and also give opportunities to develop new mathematical skills. Last term, you will also have received a password for Education City, which is a child-friendly website and will allow your child to complete homework tasks set by the teachers, related to the learning that has taken place in the classroom.





Events to look forward to include:



Wednesday, 6th May  Year 1 and 2 Sports Day

Friday, 8th May  KS1 Parents ‘Coffee and Chat’

Monday, 25th May Year 1, 2 and 3 Swimming Gala

Tuesday, 2rd June Year 2 Production



Each Year 2 class will continue to share with you what has been happening in class via the class portal blogs any changes to normal school routine or important dates or events will be shared with you via the school calendar, so it is important that these are checked regularly.



For safeguarding purposes, can we ask that adults wear their identification tags at all times within school and if your child is due to be collected by someone else, please do inform us in advance.



I hope this letter gives you a brief insight into what your child will be learning this term. As always, if you have any questions or concerns please contact your class teacher as a first point of contact.



Kind regards,



Year 2 Team
