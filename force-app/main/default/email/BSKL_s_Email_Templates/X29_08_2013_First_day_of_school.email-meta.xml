Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

I hope you had a successful and informative afternoon at the ‘Meet the tutor’ day. Further to my letter last week, could you please ensure that all pupils come to school on Monday with PE kit, and on Tuesday with swimming kit.

Thank you.

Kind Regards,

Derek Mackey
