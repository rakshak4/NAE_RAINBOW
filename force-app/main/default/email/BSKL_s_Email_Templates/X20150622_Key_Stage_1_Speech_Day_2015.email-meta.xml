Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Please find attached your invitation for Key Stage 1 Speech Day. I am pleased to announce that this year&apos;s guest speaker is Mr Sam Yang. Sam is CEO of Kingdom Education and we are looking forward to welcoming him back to BSKL.

Sam freely admits he wasn&apos;t a star pupil at school, but through hard work and determination he went on to enjoy success as a merchant banker, working for some of the wealthiest people in the world. Sam came to realise that money wasn&apos;t everything and now works to promote the development of education, sport, and international exchange throughout Asia, the USA and the UK through his charity, Kingdom Education.

Speech Day is the most important date in our calendar for celebrating the success of all of our pupils; I look forward to seeing you there. Please RSVP using the following link: RSVP form

Debra Birchall
