Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We are continually trying to improve our school lunches to provide a healthier and appetizing meal for our children.

In accordance with the above, we have made a few changes to the lunch menu as a trial run for two weeks starting from the 27th May 2013 â€“ 7th June 2013.  We are introducing a choice of sandwiches on whole meal bread that children can have with salad and sauce on the side.

We would appreciate if you could select the lunch menu for your child and hand them to the reception or email them to azizan.sallehhuddin@britishschool.edu.my no later by Wednesday 22nd May 2013.

We apologise for the inconvenience caused.

Thank you for your support and cooperation.

Warm Regards,

Janet Brock
