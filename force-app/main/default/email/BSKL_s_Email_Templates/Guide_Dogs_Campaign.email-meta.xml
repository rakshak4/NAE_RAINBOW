Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

The school is supporting a charity called ‘Ones for Sight’ whose aim to raise money to bring in guide dogs for the blind to Malaysia for the visually impaired community –especially children.
For more information on this very worthwhile cause please follow the below link where you can peruse further details:

Guide Dogs Campaign

To garner funds for the Guide Dogs cause, Ones for Sight have started the 100,000 signatures campaign. A postcard has been printed to ask the public to sign the card in support of the movement  and a minimum donation of RM 10 is greatly appreciated for each signed card.  The school will be putting these postcards at the school reception whereby you can sign, donate and support this cause.

You can also visit their Facebook page ‘Dogs for Sight’ for further information on guide dogs.

Thank you as always for your support.
