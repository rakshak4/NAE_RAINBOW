Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName}



Year 3 Curriculum – Term 3



Welcome back to the start of a new term.  I hope you have had a great Easter break and the children are as enthusiastic as the Year 3 team are about the exciting topics ahead.



As you are aware we run a literacy-based thematic curriculum with the children studying a different topic each term. In this term, we will be focusing on ‘Romans, Rocks and Volcanoes’ and this will run across many of the subjects we will be teaching in class.  The English, numeracy and science curriculum we teach is in line with the new English National Curriculum.



English



We will be starting our term reading and learning about different diaries from the popular ‘Diary of a Wimpy Kid’ to ‘The Diary of a Roman Slave’. A diary (or journal) is a book in which someone writes down their feelings, important events and experiences from their life. The children will learn a text and then use this to help them write their own diary as a Roman citizen. We will then be looking at instructional writing again in conjunction with our Roman topic. We will follow instructions on how to make a Roman shield and then looking at our science topic of Volcanoes and then write our own instructions on how to make a volcano. Explosive stuff! Finally, we will look at adventure/mystery stories. Using the ‘Talk for Writing’ technique,  we will imitate the text, then innovate our ideas, concluding with the invention of our own story. As well as covering spelling, punctuation and grammar in our daily English lessons, the children will continue with a separate weekly lesson dedicated to these areas and reading and handwriting sessions.



Mathematics



The children will continue to develop their fluency with whole numbers within addition, subtraction, multiplication and division and increase their understanding of number facts and the concept of place value.  They will be using split multiplication and division to calculate more challenging multiplication and division problems. We will be consolidating how to record and estimate measurements, recognise the properties of 2D and 3D shape and look at interpreting and presenting statistics and will also be introduced to Roman numerals and have an introduction to perimeter as part of geometry. We will be encouraging children to continue improving their knowledge of times tables and corresponding division facts through the weekly challenge of ‘Multiplication Ninjas’.



Science



Our Science topics this term are ‘Light’ and ‘Rocks’.  When we study Light, the children will gain a deeper understanding of how light is reflected from different surfaces. We will also recap what we have previously learnt about how shadows are formed and try to find patterns in the way that the sizes of shadows change. When we study Rocks and Soils, the children will identify comparisons and similarities of a range of rocks and group them based on physical appearance and properties. We will also be learning how fossils are made and gain an understanding of how rocks are made from organic matter.



Computing



In computing we will continuing with our focus on E-Safety and coding. We will also be learning how to use different software and be using the app ‘GarageBand’ to create and produce a range of music both independently and in groups.



Topic



In topic sessions, our theme will be ‘Romans’.  This will cover a range of areas. We will begin using a timeline of the Roman Empire to look at how it grew and developed over a period of time. We will be locating countries in an atlas which were part of the Roman Empire and finding out more about how the Roman army and government ruled and fought and express our opinions on their effectiveness.



Through art and design, we will take a closer look at Pompeii and the famous eruption of Mount Vesuvius and make our own volcanoes. We will be designing and making shields and re-enacting a Roman Battle, giving us an insight into the life of a Roman soldier. We will also look at a variety of artwork through a mosaic style and produce some of our own.



MFL



Year 3 children will continue studying either Mandarin or Spanish.  Mandarin lessons are differentiated by ability due to the wide range of competency amongst our children.  This term Mandarin lessons will be covering the following topics:



Basic: Food and Beverage, School and Uniform, Stationery and My House

Beginner: Time and Routines, Food and Beverage, Transportation and Hobbies

Heritage: Time and Routines, Transportation and Hobbies, Healthy Food and Currency



In Spanish, the children will be covering a number of short topics including: Sports and Hobbies, Animals (farm and wild animals), Food, Time (daily routines) and Summer Festivals in Spain. Throughout the topic work we will be incorporating lots of new vocabulary and using songs, role play, stories and creative activities to continue to develop the children&apos;s speaking, reading and writing skills in Spanish.



Malaysian children will also continue to study Bahasa. Topics for term 3 include Musical Instruments and Daily Activities.



Music



Topics to be covered in music this term include: Painting With Sound - where we will explore the ways in which music can describe images, mood, texture and expression. The children will also learn to relate sounds to visual images and emotions and Salt, Pepper, Vinegar, Mustard - where we will explore singing games.



PE



In PE, the Year 3 children will continue with their swimming lessons on the same day as in Term 2.  In their other two lessons, they will be introduced to Outdoor and Adventurous Activities (OAA), which will include using the climbing wall/bouldering area and team building activities.  They will take part in athletics, which will include running,  jumping and throwing activities to prepare them for Sports Day, which is later in Term 3.  They will also get the opportunity to learn some Unihoc skills (hockey type skills) and try out some dance moves.



Homework



Homework will continue to be sent out twice a week by the class teacher and this will include 30 minutes of maths and 30 minutes of literacy or topic/science work. Literacy or science/topic will be set on Monday and be due on Wednesday. Maths will be set on Wednesday and be due by Friday. Occasionally, a task may be set which we will allow more time for completion, however we will inform you of this when it occurs. Spellings will be sent out each Friday along with mental maths to learn and all children are expected to read at home. The children will also receive weekly homework from their Modern Foreign Language (MFL) – Spanish or Mandarin,



Events to look forward to include:



Monday,  18th May  Year 5 &amp; 6 Sports Day

Friday, 22nd  May  5D Class Assembly

Thursday 11th June Primary Open Day

Friday, 12th June   KS2 Parents ‘Coffee and Chat’



Each Year 3 class will continue to share with you what has been happening in class via the class Parent Portal blogs. Any changes to normal school routine or important dates or events will be shared with you via the school calendar and we encourage parents to check the Parent Portal calendar regularly.



For safeguarding purposes, can we ask that adults wear their identification tags at all times within school and if your child is due to be collected by someone else, please do inform us in advance.



I hope this letter gives you a brief insight into what your child will be learning this term. As always, if you have any questions or concerns please contact your class teacher as a first point of contact.



Kind regards,



The Year 3 team
