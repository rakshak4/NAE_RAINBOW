Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We are all aware that there is a General Election on Sunday 5th May. It has been suggested that there may be a public holiday on Monday 6th May.

I would just like to inform all of you that BSKL will be open as normal, but if any parent chooses to keep their child(ren) off if a public holiday is declared then that is your decision.

Warm regards

Janet Brock
Headteacher
