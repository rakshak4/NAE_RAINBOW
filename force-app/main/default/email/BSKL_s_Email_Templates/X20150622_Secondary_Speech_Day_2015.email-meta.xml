Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Please find attached your invitation for Secondary Speech Day. I am pleased to announce that this year&apos;s guest speaker is Mr Sam Yang. Sam is CEO of Kingdom Education and has already made quite an impression on a number of our Year 9 and 10 pupils - I am looking forward to welcoming him back to BSKL. He is heavily involved in the promotion and development of education, sport, and international exchange throughout Asia, the USA and the UK.

Speech Day is the most important date in our calendar for celebrating the success of all of our pupils; I look forward to seeing you there. Please RSVP using the following link: RSVP form
