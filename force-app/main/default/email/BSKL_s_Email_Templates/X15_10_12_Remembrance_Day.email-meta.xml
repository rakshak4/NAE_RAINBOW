Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

BSKL REMEMBRANCE DAY, MONDAY 5TH NOVEMBER 2012

This year’s assembly to commemorate Remembrance Day will be held on Monday 5th November 2012.

In light of the occasion, it has been deemed compulsory for all students from Year 1 to Year 8 to dress formally in the school blazer.   This assembly is only for Primary and Middle School pupils.

Warrant Officer Paul Cross from The British High Commission will be visiting BSKL and conducting part of the morning’s assembly which will culminate in the student body singing ‘Make me a channel of your peace’.  There will also be a minute’s silence, wreath laying ceremony, Last Post and Reveille.  The assembly is to honour those who gave their lives in conflict.

Furthermore as a mark of respect for this day BSKL will be offering poppies at the school reception.   A minimum donation of RM 5 for each poppy is politely requested.  The money raised will go to The British Legion.

Thank you.

Kind Regards,

Administration Team
The British International School of Kuala Lumpur
