Your child has such an exciting, action packed term ahead of them. This letter will tell you all about the sorts of things that will happen in Nursery, so that you can help to prepare your child for their wonderful learning journey.</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><u><b>What happens when?</b></u></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><ul><li>Our soft start time is 7:45 – 8:30am every day. During this time you will be able to join your child in their classroom to ‘stay and play’. The register will be taken at 8:30am, so please do ensure that your child is present by that time.&nbsp;</li><li>On <u>swimming days</u> (Monday) please send the following named items in a bag: swimming costume, towel, swimming hat and easy to put on and remove pool shoes. Please send your child to school on Monday’s wearing their PE kit and trainers.</li><li>On PE days (Friday) your child can come to school dressed in their PE kit and their trainers.&nbsp;</li><li>It’s really important that you name all items of clothing, shoes, water bottles, hats and bags. Everything looks the same so it can be very confusing for the teachers as well as the children. A complete spare change of uniform, including socks and underwear should be left in a named bag in your child’s locker every day, in case of little accidents.</li><li>Please remember that sun hats should be in school at all times and your child should bring a fresh bottle of water with them everyday. &nbsp;A healthy afternoon snack is also required (no nuts or nut products please).</li><li>Please regularly log into our Parent Portal to look at the online calendar. This is where you will find information about forthcoming events, such as dress up days, concerts, trips etc.</li></ul></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><u><b>How will your child be learning this term?</b></u></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><u><br></u></div><div style="margin: 0px;">Initially this term our focus will be on helping the children to settle into their new class. We will be learning about our class names (Robins, Penguins and Puffins) and very importantly the school’s ‘Golden Rules’. This will involve learning about ‘good choices’, sharing, taking turns, helping to tidy up and being kind to each other.</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;">In the Early Years Foundation Stage children learn by playing and exploring, being active, and through creative and critical thinking which takes place both indoors and outside. In Nursery our learning environment is organised into different areas, with children being able to move freely between them and the shared space outside the classrooms at certain times of the day. We call this ‘freeflow’. Each of the classrooms has a different range of activities on offer, with children are able to visit.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><ul><li>The Puffin class is a cosy room where children can take part in quiet activities, such as threading, jigsaws and drawing.</li><li>The Penguin class is where they can investigate their world, use a variety of IT equipment and take part in a range of mathematical challenges and activities.</li><li>The Robin class has lots of messy play experiences on offer, such as making, playdough, exploring shaving foam, junk modelling and painting.</li></ul></div><div style="margin: 0px;">Every classroom, on top of all these specific areas still has materials and equipment to support all the other areas of learning such as literacy, mathematics, understanding the world, physical and creative development. Each week the Nursery teachers will meet to review the children’s learning and plan for the following week; basing activities, resources and learning opportunities on the interests of the children. Our topics will change and expand according to the children’s interests and you can follow our weekly progress via the Parent Portal. Tasks will be fun and practical, using both the inside and outside learning environments. The teachers and other adults supporting your child will make sure that the activities are suited to your child’s unique needs.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><u><b>Phonics</b></u></div><div style="margin: 0px;">Your child will participate in a phonics lesson every day when we will be exploring rhyme, alliteration and developing vocabulary to talk about sounds. Speaking, understanding and listening skills will also play a large part in our daily activities.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;">Please do find time to enjoy reading books to/with your child at home. Developing a love of books at this early age will really help them to develop their writing, speaking and listening skills.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><u><b>What about mathematics?</b></u></div><div style="margin: 0px;">Don’t worry there are also plenty of mathematical opportunities. The children will be developing their confidence with number, shape, space and size through practical activities, number rhymes and stories. We will be singing a variety of familiar and new number rhymes to support their understanding of number (sequence), calculations (one more / one less). There will be lots of practical and fun activities to support their understanding of number.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><u><b>Modern Foreign Languages (MFL)</b></u></div><div style="margin: 0px;">Chinese and Spanish language lessons take part four days a week, with learning being linked to the Nursery topics and the children’s interests. The Modern Foreign Language’s staff will often use both the inside and outside spaces in the same way that the Nursery teachers do, with children being able to continue their learning through play in Mandarin or Spanish.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><u><b>Can parents help?</b></u></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><ul><li>We always welcome donations small junk boxes, bottle tops, jar lids, cardboard tubes, corks, scrap materials and other things that we can use in our model making areas.</li><li>Please log into the Parent Portal at least once a week to keep up to date with school news, events and to see lots of lovely photos and videos of the children in action!</li></ul></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><u><b>Home-time</b></u></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><ul><li>The Nursery home time is 2:30pm Monday to Thursday and 2pm on a Friday.&nbsp;</li><li>To ensure the safety of all children, adults are required to wear their identification tags at all times within school.&nbsp;</li><li>If your child is due to be collected by someone else please do inform us in advance.&nbsp;</li></ul></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><u><b>Illness</b></u></div><div style="margin: 0px;">Please remember that if your child has had sickness or diarrhoea, then they are not to attend school for 48 hours after the last bout. If your child has a temperature, they should also stay at home until the temperature has gone and your child is feeling better. &nbsp; If your child becomes ill or unwell at school, the school nurse will contact you and request that you come and collect them.</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><u><b>Stay in touch!</b></u></div><div style="margin: 0px;">Your views are important to us and we are keen to work in partnership with all parents. Please do contact us if you have a question or any feedback.</div><div style="margin: 0px;">&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;">We look forward to working with you throughout the term.</div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;"><br></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;"><br></div><font face="arial"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Warm Regards,</span></font></font></div></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-spacing: 5px;"><div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Natasha Daynes (Nursery Year Group Leader) and Miss Elena (Robins Class NC)</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">natasha.daynes@britishschool.edu.my</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Julie Scott &nbsp;and &nbsp;Miss Ani (Penguin Class NA)</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">julie.scott@britishschool.edu.my</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><br></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Nickie Shaw &nbsp;and Miss Charlie (Puffin Class NB)&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">nickie.shaw@britishschool.edu.my</p></div><div style="text-align: justify;"><br></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: justify;"><br></div></span></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif">{!Contact.SchoolText__c}</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><i><font class="Apple-style-span" color="#ff6600"><b>World Class Education</b></font></i></span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif">__________________________________________________________</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="1">{!User.School_List_Email_Footer__c}</font><font class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;" face="Arial, sans-serif" size="1">&nbsp;</font></div>]]></td>
