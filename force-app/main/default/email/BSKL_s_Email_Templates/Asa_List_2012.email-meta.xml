Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

I hope this email finds you all well.
We would like to thank you all, for your patience and cooperation with the ASA emails. We have now completed the ASA registers from all the emails and applications we have received. The registers are attached to this email for your attention.
Please check them to see which ASA&apos;s your children have been placed in. We have tried to place all the pupils in their first choice clubs and emails have been reviewed in the order they have been received. We hope the pupils are looking forward to getting started next week.
