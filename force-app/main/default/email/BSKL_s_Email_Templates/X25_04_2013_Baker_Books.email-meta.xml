Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Baker Books is a UK based young readers books company and I have created an account with them. They have an excellent and varied range of titles, for very young children, up to older children. I am giving out the catalogues to all the children for them to choose books.

The great and convenient thing about Baker Books is that you as a parent can pay online with credit or debit card.

It is very easy to do: you go to this link:

http://parentpay.bakerbooks.co.uk/clubs/BRIMAL1

You then order from there, entering your child&apos;s name and class.  The books are then dispatched by class name to the school.

Please note that there is a deadline for the orders to be done by. This is May 15th, so please make sure you order your books before then.

If you have any questions please contact me at  alan.savage@britishschool.edu.my

Thank you and happy reading for your children!
