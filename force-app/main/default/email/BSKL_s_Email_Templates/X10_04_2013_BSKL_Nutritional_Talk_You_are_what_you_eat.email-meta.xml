Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

There will be a special Middle School assembly in Friday that you are all invited to.

“You are what you eat”

ILIFE Nutrition have been invited to BSKL to give a presentation to the Middle School students as part of the Year 6 PSHE programme. They will be talking about both healthy and unhealthy choices that the students make and how they can change for the better but not forgetting the impact on the body system if students continue to make unhealthy choices with regards to their diet. They will also talk a little bit about exercise too.

It would be great to see as many of you as possible to support this important educational message.

You can find out more about the company presenting at:

Kind regards
Richard Lambros and Louise Brashier
