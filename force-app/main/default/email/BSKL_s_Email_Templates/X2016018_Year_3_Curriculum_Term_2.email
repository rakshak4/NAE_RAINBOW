I hope you have had a great Christmas break and the children are as eager as the Year 3 team are about the exciting topics ahead.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">As you are aware we run a literacy-based thematic curriculum with the children studying a different topic each term. In this term, we will be focusing on ‘A Passport to Asia’ and this will run across many of the subjects we will be teaching in class. The English, numeracy and science curriculum we teach is in line with the new English National Curriculum.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><b>English</b></font></div><div><font size="4">We will be starting our term learning a variety of poetry styles such as concrete/shape poems and calligrams. Next, our focus on stories from different cultures will include, ‘Wombat Goes Walkabout’. Within this unit, we will be learning to write traditional stories. In the second part of Term 2, we will follow the Chinese New Year (CNY) holiday looking at picture books linked to CNY and the Chinese Horoscopes which will lead onto the children writing their own Chinese themed story. Our final English unit in Term 2 will look at ‘Explanations and Instructions’. As well as covering spelling, punctuation and grammar in our daily English lessons, the children will continue with a separate weekly lesson &nbsp;dedicated to these areas and additional reading and handwriting sessions.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><b>Mathematics</b></font></div><div><font size="4">In mathematics, the children will have daily lessons ensuring that all aspects of the mathematics curriculum are covered during the year. &nbsp;We will continue working on a Mastery approach, which involves learning different aspects for longer periods until the students become ‘masters’ in the topic. &nbsp;This term, the students will focus on learning Fractions, Measurement and Properties of Shape. Fluency of number is a key focus and the children will also continue to climb the Multiplication Ninja belt chart in our weekly challenges. &nbsp;</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><b>Science</b></font></div><div><font size="4">Our science topics this term are ‘Plants’ and ‘Humans, including Animals’. When we study plants, the children will gain a deeper understanding of the parts of a plant and their function. They will recap what plants require for life and growth, investigate how water is transported within plants and about the life-cycle of flowering plants. The children will also learn about nutrition and how unlike plants, humans and animals cannot make their own food; the nutrition comes from what they eat. They will also learn to identify how different animals have skeletons and muscle for different support, protection and movement.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><b>Computing</b></font></div><div><font size="4">In computing the children will be covering a new exciting area; robotics, which will see the children design, create and operate their own robot. &nbsp;This will be done as weekly lessons and each lesson will continue to build upon the previous one.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><b>Integrated Curriculum</b></font></div><div><font size="4">In topic sessions, our theme will be ‘A Passport to Asia’. This will cover a range of areas including: locating countries in the world, with a particular focus on South-East Asia concentrating on the environmental regions, key physical and human characteristics, countries and major cities. We will be using maps, atlases, globes and digital (computer) mapping to locate countries and describe features studied.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Through Art and Design, we will be using a range of materials creatively to design and make products including batik painting and we will be researching local artists to analyse their creations and techniques. &nbsp;Linking to our topic, we will attempt to design and create buildings in South-East Asia, using sculpture as the focus.</font></div><div><font size="4"><b><br></b></font></div><div><font size="4"><b>Modern Foreign Languages (MFL)</b></font></div><div><font size="4">Year 3 children will continue studying either Mandarin or Spanish. Mandarin lessons are differentiated by ability due to the wide range of competency amongst our children.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">In Term 2, the Mandarin lessons in Year 3 for basic level will be covering the topics of ‘My Body’ and ‘My Family’. Beginner level will be covering the topics of ‘Chinese Zodiac’, ‘Birthday’ and ‘Days of week and Month’. Elementary level will be covering the topics of ‘Friends’, ‘Appearance description’ and ‘Clothing’. &nbsp;We will continue to reinforce their listening and speaking skills as well as building up their reading and writing skills. The heritage group will be focusing on the passage, ‘Jin Tian De Tian Qi Zen Me Yang’ (How’s the weather today) and ‘Bei Jing De Si Ji’ (The Four Seasons in Beijing). Besides that, this group will be extended further by learning a wider range of vocabulary and writing descriptions of characters. Furthermore, children will also learning Chinese New Year traditions and culture in Term 2.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">The Spanish curriculum will cover a number of short topics next term including describing the face and body, physical and personality descriptions of family members, clothes and fashion, as well as learning vocabulary and questions regarding what would be found at the cafe.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">In Bahasa, the children will build up their vocabulary and speaking skills focusing on two topics: Makanan dan Minuman – Food and Drinks and Haiwan Peliharaan – Pets.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><b>Music</b></font></div><div><font size="4">The children will continue to learn how to play either violin, viola or cello as part of our Primary Instrumental Programme (PIPs) lessons. In their music lessons, they will be exploring musical arrangements through the theme, ‘The Class Orchestra’ and pentatonic scales through a theme called ‘Dragon Scales’.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><b>PE</b></font></div><div><font size="4">In their PE lessons, over the course of Term 2 and the start of Term 3, the Year 3 children will take part in the following activities: &nbsp;unihoc, tag rugby, Outdoor Adventure Activities (OAA), using the climbing wall, gymnastics, athletics, dance, net/wall games and striking and fielding activities. &nbsp;These activities will be rotated throughout the term, so that all groups take part in all activities. The children will require a hat for PE, as some of these activities will take place on the Primary roof space. They will continue to have their swimming lesson on the same day as last term.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><b>Homework</b></font></div><div><font size="4">Homework will continue to be sent out on a Wednesday by the class teacher and this will include approximately 30 minutes of Maths and 30 minutes of English or Topic/Science work. Occasionally, a task may be set which we will allow more time for completion, however we will inform you of this when it occurs. Spelling rules will be sent out each Wednesday. The children will also receive weekly homework from their Modern Foreign Languages teacher – Spanish or Mandarin (MFL).</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><b>Communication</b></font></div><div><font size="4">Each Year 3 class will continue to share with you what has been happening in class via the class portals; any changes to normal school routine or important dates or events will be shared with you via the school calendar, so it is important that these are checked regularly.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">For safeguarding purposes, we ask that adults wear their identification tags at all times within school and if your child is due to be collected by someone else, please do inform us in advance.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">I hope this letter gives you a brief insight into what your child will be learning this term. As always, if you have any questions or concerns please contact your class teacher as a first point of contact.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Kind regards,</font></div><div><b style="font-size: large;"><br></b></div><div><b style="font-size: large;">Year 3 Team</b></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Mr. Scott (Year Group Leader) &amp; Ms. Sinead</font></div><div><font size="4">stephen.scott@britishschool.edu.my</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Ms. Randall &amp; Ms. Dylan</font></div><div><font size="4">simone.randall@britishschool.edu.my</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Mrs. Dallas &amp; Ms. Isobel</font></div><div><font size="4">lavinia.dallas@britishschool.edu.my</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Ms. Winser &amp; Mr. Jeff</font></div><div><font size="4">sarah.winser@britishschool.edu.my</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Ms. Moses &amp; Ms. Catherine</font></div><div><font size="4">sarah.moses@britishschool.edu.my</font></div></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;"><br></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;"><br></div></div></span></font></div></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif">{!Contact.SchoolText__c}</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><i><font class="Apple-style-span" color="#ff6600"><b>World Class Education</b></font></i></span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif">__________________________________________________________</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="1">{!User.School_List_Email_Footer__c}</font><font class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;" face="Arial, sans-serif" size="1">&nbsp;</font></div>]]></td>
