Your child has a fun-filled, action packed term ahead of them. This letter will tell you all about the sorts of things that will happen in Reception, so that you can help to prepare your child for their exciting learning journey.</span></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Highlights of last term</b></div><div>Your child had a great first term and has already made so much progress. Our topics last term included ‘All About Me’, ‘Jungle Animals’, ‘Caring for our World’ and ‘Christmas’. Children particularly enjoyed using our exciting role play areas (a house, jungle, garden centre and a Christmas cafe), going to see a theatre production of Oliver Jeffers’ well known book, ‘The Way Back Home’, and our Early Years trip to the Jungle Gym. The term ended on a high with the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) Christmas show ‘A Little Nativity’. The performance was a great success and it was wonderful to see the children joining in with so much enthusiasm.</div><div><br></div><div><b>What happens when?</b></div><div><ul><li>Please remember that you can find out when your child has their swimming and PE lessons by reading the information on the Parent Portal.</li><li>On PE days your child can come to school dressed in their PE kit and their trainers.</li><li>On swimming days please send the following named items in a bag: swimming costume, goggles, towel, swimming hat and pool shoes. Your child can come to school wearing their PE kit on their swimming day.&nbsp;</li><li>It’s really important that you name all items of clothing, shoes, water bottles, hats and bags. Everything looks the same so it can be very confusing for the teachers as well as the child.</li><li>Please remember that sun hats should be in school at all times and your child should bring a fresh bottle of water with them everyday.</li></ul></div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>How will your child be learning this term?</b></div><div>Initially this term we will base our learning around the topic ‘Transport and Travel’. We will start off by providing the children with plenty of opportunities to talk about what they did in the holidays, places they visited, and the modes of transport they used. Please do send in any photos, leaflets, postcards, tickets from places that you visited. Perhaps you might like to read the following books at home with your child to compliment our topic; - Oi! Get off our Train by John Burningham, Duck in the Truck by Jez Alborough, Naughty Bus by Jan Oke.</div><div><br></div><div>Each week the Reception teachers will meet to review the children’s learning and plan for the following week. Our topics will expand according to the children’s interests and may vary from class to class. Don’t worry though, you can follow our weekly progress via the Parent Portal. Tasks will be fun and practical, using both the inside and outside learning environments. The teachers and other adults supporting your child will make sure that the activities are suited to your child’s unique needs.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Phonics</b></div><div>Your child will continue to take part in a phonics lesson every day, following the Letters and Sounds programme. We will tell you which letters / sounds / words we are learning each week so that you can help your child to continue their learning at home. Please do read the Parent Portal every week so that you can keep up to date with our progress. You can also find phonics games, complementing the Letters and Sounds phases, on the website PhonicsPlay.co.uk, as well as the Jolly Phonics songs and actions on Youtube.</div><div><br></div><div>We will build on the writing skills that we developed last term and children will be given a variety of different meaningful writing opportunities, such as lists, letters, stories and factual accounts. They will learn about finger spaces, capital letters and full stops, and will have a go at writing a range of common words from memory as well as tricky words using their phonic skills.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Children will continue to bring home new reading books every week. They will usually be given two books at a time and these books are chosen according to their ability. &nbsp;In order to provide the children with a range of texts and genres, we use a combination of reading schemes which include fiction, poetry, non-fiction and real books. &nbsp;Please do find time to enjoy the books with your child at home, as well as reading your child’s lists of tricky words together. We are really keen to promote a love of books and an enjoyment of reading from a very young age. It is therefore important that your child brings their reading bag to school every day.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>What about mathematics?</b></div><div>Don’t worry; there are also plenty of mathematical opportunities. The children will be developing their confidence with number, shape, space and size through practical activities, number rhymes and stories. We will be singing a variety of familiar and new number rhymes to support the children’s understanding of number (sequence), calculations (one more / one less), pattern and measure (height, capacity, weight). There will be lots of practical, fun activities to support understanding of simple number problems (such as how many different ways to make ten or more), as well as using different methods and resources to solve simple addition and subtraction questions.&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Modern Foreign Languages (MFL)</b></div><div>Chinese and Spanish language lessons continue this term with learning being linked to the Reception topics. If you are new to the school, please do let your child’s teacher know which language you would like your child to learn.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><b>Can parents help?</b></div><div><ul><li>We always welcome donations of junk boxes, bottle tops, cardboard tubes, corks and other things that we can use in our model making areas.</li><li>Please log into the Parent Portal at least once a week to keep up to date with school news, events and to see lots of lovely photos and videos of the children ‘in action’.</li><li>Please speak to your child’s teacher or teaching assistant if you would like to help with listening to the children read on a regular basis.</li></ul></div><div><br></div><div><b>Illness</b></div><div>Please remember that if your child has had sickness or diarrhoea, then they are not to attend school for 48 hours after the last bout. If your child has a temperature, they should also stay at home until the temperature has gone and your child is feeling better. If your child becomes ill or unwell at school, the school nurse will contact you and request that you come and collect them.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Communication</b></div><div>Please regularly log into our Parent Portal to look at the online calendar. This is where you will find &nbsp; &nbsp;information about forthcoming events, such as dress up days, concerts, trips etc.</div><div><br></div><div>Each Reception class will continue to share with you what has been happening in class via the class portals. Any changes to normal school routine will be shared as a notification and all important dates are shared as an event via the school calendar, so it is important that this is checked regularly.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>For safeguarding purposes, we ask that adults wear their identification tags at all times within school and if your child is due to be collected by someone else, please do inform us in advance.</div><div><br></div><div>Your views are important to us and we are keen to work in partnership with all parents. Please do contact us if you have a question or any feedback. We look forward to working with you throughout the term.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Kind regards,</div><div><br></div><div><b>Reception team</b></div><div><br></div><div>Miss Marshall (Reception Year Group Leader) (Dragonflies, Class RA)</div><div>tor.marshall@britishschool.edu.my</div><div><br></div><div>Mrs Townend (Head of Early Years) (Ladybirds, Class RD)</div><div>sarah.townend@britishschool.edu.my</div><div><br></div><div>Miss Powell (Bumblebees, Class RB)</div><div>natalie.powell@britishschool.edu.my</div><div><br></div><div>Miss Bannerman (Butterflies, Class RC)</div><div>andrea.bannerman@britishschool.edu.my</div><div><br></div><div>Reception year group supporting teaching assistants: Miss Ruth, Miss Anna, Miss Lee Wen, Mrs Dee and Miss Jade.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>The British International School &nbsp;Kuala Lumpur is a member of The British Schools Foundation</div><div>Kuala-Lumpur - Manila - Marbella - Moscow - Nanjing</div><div>New York - Pamplona - Sao Paulo - Tashkent - Yangon</div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;"><br></div></span></font></div></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-spacing: 5px;"><div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify; "><br></p></div></span></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif">{!Contact.SchoolText__c}</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; "><i><font class="Apple-style-span" color="#ff6600"><b>World Class Education</b></font></i></span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif">__________________________________________________________</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="1">{!User.School_List_Email_Footer__c}</font><font class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;" face="Arial, sans-serif" size="1">&nbsp;</font></div>]]></td>
