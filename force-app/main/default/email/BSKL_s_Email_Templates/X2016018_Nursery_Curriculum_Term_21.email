The purpose of this letter is to provide you with some information about what your children will be enjoying in Year 1 this term, as well as to update you on forthcoming events.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">We are very excited about this term’s topics: ‘Under the Sea’ followed by ‘Traditional Tales’. We will be focusing on a variety of stories related to these themes and all subjects will be linked, as much as possible, so that our learning is all encompassing and above all enjoyable. For example, when we start to learn about plants we will link this with some traditional tales like ‘Jack and the Beanstalk’. Whilst we are reading stories related to ‘Under the Sea’, we will begin to learn about the creatures that swim in our oceans and then proceed to learning about the oceans and continents of the world. &nbsp;Year 1 will be creating our very own settings from these stories so watch this space.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><b><font size="4">English</font></b></div><div><font size="4">We will be sharing a selection of stories around our ‘Under the Sea’ and ‘Traditional Tales’ themes. We will use our imagination and immerse ourselves into these worlds, learning all about both fictional and non-fiction books related to the ocean, as well as traditional tales. &nbsp;We will also be enjoying some ocean themed poems focusing on rhyming patterns. &nbsp;Later in the term, we will be finding out about the features of reports and use this to create our own reports about ocean creatures using the internet and a variety of texts to help with our research.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Phonics is differentiated according children's knowledge and individual needs. Each group will focus on teaching a particular set of sounds, following the Letters and Sounds programme, in a fun and interactive way to ensure the children are learning and applying their skills at their own pace, &nbsp;in a more dynamic targeted way.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><b><font size="4">Mathematics</font></b></div><div><font size="4">The children will have daily Mathematics lessons ensuring that all aspects of Mathematics curriculum are covered during the year. &nbsp;Among other things, this term we will be learning to; count up to and back from 40, beginning from 0 or 1, or from any given number, as well as read and write numbers from 1 to 40 in numerals and words. We will identify and represent numbers using objects and pictorial representations and extend the children’s mathematical language (more than, less than, most, least).</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Year 1 will continue to learn to represent and use number bonds, as well as related subtraction facts within 20 (for example, if we know that 16 + 4 = 20, then we should also know that 20 – 4 = 16, and so on). We will extend addition and subtraction, through adding one-digit and two-digit numbers to 20 and solving one-step problems using objects and pictures.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Term 2 will also introduce ‘time’ where children will be taught to read the time to the hour and half past the hour, whilst also beginning to recognise language relating to dates (days of the week, months of the year, etc). Furthermore, we will compare, describe and solve practical problems for time (for example, faster, quicker, slower, earlier and later) and measure and begin to record time (hours, minutes, seconds). Lastly, we will sequence events in chronological order using language related to time (for example, before and after, next, first, today, yesterday, tomorrow and so on).</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><b><font size="4">Integrated Curriculum</font></b></div><div><font size="4">Will have a strong geographic focus this term and the children will be learning about oceans and continents from around the world. &nbsp;We will be using maps and atlases to identify these. Seasons will be introduced towards the end of the term, linking learning to science, and finding out about places around the world with different weather patterns and the location of hot and cold areas of the world in relation to the Equator and the North and South Poles. children will also locate forests both in Europe and Malaysia, identifying similarities and differences between Asian forests and European forests.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Art and Design Technology (DT) will initially be sea-themed where all Year 1 classes will be creating an ocean scene collaboratively. Thereafter, when learning about plants, the children will be introduced to Vincent Van Gogh and will create their own drawing and, subsequently, their own painting of a sunflower. &nbsp;</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><b><font size="4">Science&nbsp;</font></b></div><div><font size="4">Linking the children's learning from Geography, we will be observing changes across the seasons, observing and describing the weather associated with each of these. The children will also identify and describe the basic structure of a variety of common flowering plants, and name a variety of common wild and garden plants, including deciduous and evergreen trees.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><b><font size="4">Computing</font></b></div><div><font size="4">We will be extending the children’s learning, continuing from the work they have undertaken in Term 1. They will begin to gain a deeper understanding of writing code and understanding &nbsp;algorithms, for example, writing their own code to make an object appear and disappear when a designated key is pressed. We will use iPads for the children to make objects move in all directions on a screen through precise information and instruction they have given. Debugging code is also a skill that will be taught. This will involve identifying the fault if a program is not working, finding out which part of the code is creating the problem, and then working towards a fix.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><b><font size="4">Physical Education (PE)</font></b></div><div><font size="4">In PE lessons, over the course of Term 2 and the start of Term 3, the Year 1 children will take part in the following activities: &nbsp;unihoc, Invasion Games (Rugby), Outdoor Adventure Activities (OAA) using the climbing wall, gymnastics, athletics, dance, racket skills and striking and fielding activities. These activities will be rotated throughout the term, so that all groups take part in all activities. The children will require a hat for PE, as some of these activities will take place on the primary roof space.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><b><font size="4">Music</font></b></div><div><font size="4">Feel the Pulse</font></div><div><font size="4">In this unit, the children focus on pulse / beat and rhythm through various activities, including identification of the beat in music of varying tempo and meter, recalling and copying rhythm patterns, creating rhythm patterns based on words and phrases and using beat and rhythm to create an accompaniment to a song.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Taking off (Exploring pitch)</font></div><div><font size="4">In this unit, the children focus on pitch through various activities, including listening and identification of pitch changes, moving in response to pitch changes, singing and playing simple melodies, and creating simple melodies of their own using graphic scores and notation.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><b><font size="4">Modern Foreign Languages (MFL)</font></b></div><div><b><font size="4"><br></font></b></div><div><font size="4">Mandarin</font></div><div><font size="4">In Term 2 the Mandarin lessons in Year 1 will be covering the topics of “My Body”, “My Family” and “Chinese New Year”. We will continue to reinforce the children’s listening and speaking skills as well as begin to work on their reading and writing skills. The heritage group will be focusing on the passage “Ba Ba Shi Lao Shi” (My Father is a Teacher) and 15 common Chinese characters. Furthermore, this group will be extended by learning a wider range of vocabulary and writing descriptions of characters.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Spanish</font></div><div><font size="4">The Spanish group will be covering a number of short topics this term including: The days of the week and months of the year, actions and things they like to do, ‘Clothes’ and the ‘Seasons' and the Spanish festival 'Carnival'. We will also continue to learn new vocabulary related to our phonics work as well as reviewing the vocabulary and topics we covered last term to develop the children's speaking skills.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><b><font size="4">Homework</font></b></div><div><font size="4">Children will continue to be given a weekly literacy activity (e.g. phonics/spelling) and a mathematics task of approximately 15 minutes. There may also be weeks where teachers decide that a topic activity would be more beneficial.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Please continue reading with your child every day. This time is invaluable and enhances children’s language skills.</font></div><div><font size="4">Please remember that whilst reading, it is essential to encourage discussion and ask your child questions about the texts. For example: Who is the main character? What happens when …? Where does the story take place? What do you think could happen next? Can you retell the story? How would you end this story if you could change it? Any questions that instigate discussion are good questions.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">All children have access to the mymaths and Education City websites and should have received a username and password that can be used at home. Spending short, but regular, sessions playing educational maths games will help consolidate learning and also give opportunities to develop new mathematical skills.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><b><font size="4">Communication</font></b></div><div><font size="4">Each Year 1 class will continue to share with you what has been happening in class via the class portals. Any changes to normal school routine or important dates or events will be shared with you via the school calendar, so it is important that these are checked regularly.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">For safeguarding purposes, can we ask that adults wear their identification tags at all times within school and if your child is due to be collected by someone else, please do inform us in advance.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">We hope this letter gives you a brief insight into what your child will be learning this term. As always, if you have any questions or concerns please contact your class teacher as a first point of contact.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Warm regards,</font></div><div><b><font size="4">Year 1 Team&nbsp;</font></b></div><div><b><font size="4"><br></font></b></div><div><font size="4">Marianne Leech (Year Group Leader) &amp; Ms Katherine</font></div><div><font size="4">marianne.leech@britishschool.edu.my</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Klynton Lawrence &amp; Ms Cleo&nbsp;</font></div><div><font size="4">klynton.lawrence@britishschool.edu.my</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Louise Scott &amp; Mr Chris&nbsp;</font></div><div><font size="4">louise.scott@britishschool.edu.my</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Roisin Pearson &amp; Ms Amna&nbsp;</font></div><div><font size="4">roisin.pearson@britishschool.edu.my</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4">Marissa Chin &amp; Ms Rebecca &nbsp;</font></div><div><font size="4">marissa.chin@britishschool.edu.my</font></div></div><div style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font size="4"><br></font></div><div style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><br></div></div></span></font></div></div><div style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif">{!Contact.SchoolText__c}</font></div><div style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><i><font class="Apple-style-span" color="#ff6600"><b>World Class Education</b></font></i></span></div><div style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif">__________________________________________________________</font></div><div style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="1">{!User.School_List_Email_Footer__c}</font><font class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;" face="Arial, sans-serif" size="1">&nbsp;</font></div>]]></td>
