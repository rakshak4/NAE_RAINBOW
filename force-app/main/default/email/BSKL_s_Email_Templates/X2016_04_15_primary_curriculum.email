<p class="p1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">We would like to welcome you and your child to the final term of their Reception year. Your child has a fun-filled, action packed term ahead of them. This letter will tell you all about the sorts of things that will happen in Reception, so that you can help to prepare your child for their exciting learning journey.</span></p><p class="p2" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b style="font-size: 12pt;"><font color="#3366ff">Highlights of last term</font></b><span class="s1"></span></p><p class="p1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Your child had a great second term and has continued to make super progress. Our topics last term included ‘Transport’, ‘Animals’ and ‘Spring and Easter’. Children particularly enjoyed using our exciting role play areas (a castle, a pirate ship, ‘The Three Little Pigs’, Gingerbread House), going to the theatre to see both school led performances, including Chinese New Year and ‘The Jungle Book’, as well as the UK based theatre production of ‘The Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark’ and our trip to Farm in the City.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2"><b style="font-size: 12pt;"><font color="#3366ff">What happens when?</font></b></p><p class="p1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Swimming and PE lessons remain on the same set days as in Term 2.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">On swimming days please send the following named items in a bag: swimming costume, goggles, towel, swimming hat and pool shoes. &nbsp;</span><span class="s1"></span></p><p class="p2" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">It’s really important that you name all items of clothing, shoes, water bottles, hats and bags. Everything looks the same so it can be very confusing for the teachers as well as the children!&nbsp; Please remember that sun hats should be in school at all times and your child should bring a fresh bottle of water with them every day.</span><span class="s1"></span></p><p class="p2" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Any changes to normal school routines or important dates or events (such as dress up days, concerts, trips etc.) will be shared with you via the school calendar and we encourage parents to check the online Parent Portal calendar regularly.&nbsp;</span><span class="s1"></span></p><p class="p2"><b style="font-size: 12pt;"><font color="#3366ff">How will your child be learning this term?</font></b></p><p class="p1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Initially this term, we will base our learning around the topic ‘My Body and Healthy Eating’. We will start off by asking the children to share their baby photos and to talk about how they have changed since they were born.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Each week the Reception teachers will meet to review the children’s learning and plan for the following week. Our topic will expand according to the children’s interests and you can follow our weekly progress via the Parent Portal class blogs. Tasks will be fun and practical, using both the inside and outside learning environments. The teachers and other adults supporting your child will make sure that the activities are suited to your child’s unique needs.&nbsp;</span><span class="s1"></span></p><p class="p2" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b style="font-size: 12pt;"><font color="#3366ff">Phonics</font></b><span class="s1"></span></p><p class="p1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Your child will continue to take part in a phonics lesson every day. Most of the children are now working on consolidating Phase 3 of the ‘Letters and Sounds’ Programme and some will be progressing through Phase 4 this term. We will tell you which letters / sounds / words we are learning each week so that you can help your child to continue their learning at home.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We will build on the writing skills that we developed last term and children will be given a variety of different meaningful writing opportunities, such as lists, letters, stories and factual accounts. They will learn about finger spaces, capital letters and full stops, and will ‘have a go’ at writing a range of common words from memory, as well as tricky words using their phonic skills. If your child is keen to write at home, please ensure they use the correct letter formation.</span><span class="s1"></span></p><p class="p2" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Children will continue to bring home new reading books each week, with books being changed once a week. Please do find time to enjoy the books with your child at home, as well as reading your child’s list of tricky words together. Developing a love of books at this early age will really help them to develop their writing skills. It is important that your child brings their reading bag to school every day.</span><span class="s1"></span></p><p class="p2" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b style="font-size: 12pt;"><font color="#3366ff">What about mathematics?</font></b></p><p class="p1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Don’t worry, there are also plenty of mathematical opportunities. The children will be developing their confidence with number, shape, space and size through practical activities, number rhymes and stories. We will be singing a variety of familiar and new number rhymes to support their understanding of number (sequence), calculations (one more / one less), pattern and measure (height, capacity, weight). Children will consolidate recognising and understanding numbers to 20 and when they are able to do this they will work with larger numbers up to 100. They will learn to count in 2s, 5s and 10s. There will be lots of practical, fun activities to support their understanding of simple number problems, such as how many different ways to make ten. The children will continue to develop their skills for addition and subtraction by using tactile resources and / or number lines.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2"><b style="font-size: 12pt;"><font color="#3366ff">Modern Foreign Languages (MFL)</font></b></p><p class="p1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Chinese and Spanish language lessons continue this term with children learning a range of new vocabulary through both play based activities and more formal tasks. In Spanish the children will be preparing to perform some songs in a Spanish assembly, as well as having fun in our topic work on ‘Farm Animals’, ‘Food and Healthy Eating’, ‘Days of the Week’, ‘Spanish Fiestas’, and ‘The Seaside’. In Mandarin the children will be looking at the topic ‘Emotion’, ‘Clothing’, ‘Animals’, ‘Hobby’, ‘Transportation’ and ‘Vacation’.&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b style="font-size: 12pt;"><font color="#3366ff">PE</font></b><span class="s1"></span></p><p class="p1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Children will continue with their swimming lessons.&nbsp; They will all continue to work at the big pool and will be split into four groups. The children will work on water confidence, streamlining and stroke development.&nbsp; In their other PE lessons, (across the term) they will be be taught dance/movement skills and more ‘Games Skills’ to include space awareness games, such as 'stuck-in the-mud' and instruction games, such as 'The Bean Game.'&nbsp; They will learn skills to improve their throwing and catching, patting and striking skills, using various different pieces of equipment. They will also try out skill-based activities to include running, relays and obstacle courses in preparation for Sports Day.&nbsp; They may also have the opportunity to use the bouldering area which may include the climbing wall.</span></p><p class="p2" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b style="font-size: 12pt;"><font color="#3366ff">Music</font></b><span class="s1"></span></p><p class="p1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Music lessons this term will be supporting the main class themes as they follow the children’s interest, starting with Our Bodies and Healthy Eating. The children will be exploring a variety of songs and poems related to these themes through singing, movement, dancing and playing a range of percussion instruments. We constantly work towards developing the children’s musicality through awareness of basic musical elements of pulse/rhythm, pitch/melody, metre/phrasing/structure, tempo and dynamics.</span></p><p class="p2"><b style="font-size: 12pt;"><font color="#3366ff">Events to look forward to include:</font></b></p><p class="p2" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">Friday 29th April -&nbsp;Open Morning</span><span class="s1"></span></p><p class="p1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Saturday 14th May<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>-&nbsp;<span class="Apple-tab-span"></span>Summer Fair</span></p><p class="p1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Wednesday 1st June -<span class="Apple-tab-span">&nbsp;</span>Pupil Led Consultations</span></p><p class="p1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Monday 6th&nbsp; June -&nbsp;<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>EYFS Splash Day&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Wednesday 29th June -<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>EYFS Production and End of Year Celebration Lunch</span></p><p class="p1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Friday 1st July -<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span><span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>International Day</span></p><p class="p1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Monday 11th July<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>-&nbsp;<span class="Apple-tab-span"></span>EYFS Sports Day</span></p><p class="p1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span class="s1">Tuesday, 12th July<span class="Apple-tab-span">	</span>-&nbsp;<span class="Apple-tab-span"></span>Hari Raya Celebration Day (children to dress up)</span></p><p class="p2" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><b style="font-size: 12pt;"><font color="#3366ff">Can parents help?</font></b><span class="s1"></span></p><p class="p1" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"></p><ul style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><li><span style="font-size: 12pt;">We always welcome donations of junk boxes, bottle tops, cardboard tubes, corks and other things that we can use in our model making areas.
