Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Remembrance Day is nearly upon us and children from Years 3 to 9 will be attending the school&apos;s own service on Monday 11th November.

This is a reminder to ask you to please send your child in with a 5RM (or more) donation to buy a poppy. It would be lovely to see all pupils wearing one on Monday, on their blazers.

Poppies are on sale on both campuses at the reception desks.

Thank you in advance for your support of The Royal British Legion. http://www.britishlegion.org.uk/

Kind regards
Tom Hickman
