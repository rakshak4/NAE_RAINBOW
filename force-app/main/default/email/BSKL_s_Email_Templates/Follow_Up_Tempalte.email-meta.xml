Support Request


Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},


We are sorry to bother you, but we wanted to follow up as our system shows you have not logged in to the school&apos;s parent portal. A login email was sent last Friday.

We wanted to make sure you (a) received the email (b) had no problem login in.

If you can&apos;t locate the email, please check your &quot;Spam folder&quot; or there is a chance your partner parent has received instead.

Please feel free to contact us by replying to this email (support@britishschools.co.uk) and we will be happy to re-send the login email, adjust any contact details or help out with any other issues you might have.



Regards

School Hub Support Team
