This time includes traveling times. The cost will be RM12,000 and includes the following:

• all transportation,

It does not include a tourist visa if your child requires one. Our school will inform you if you need to arrange this for your child before the dates of travel. There are limited places on the trip so please complete the attached form if you wish to register your child. Once we have a confirmed list we will inform you and you will be required to pay half the cost in order for us to book flights early. We will require this by 11th April.
