    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.LastName},

We are looking forward to welcoming your children into our school next week.


As a way of also welcoming our new parents to the Primary School we will also be holding two Parent Welcome and Information Sessions on ‘Google Meet’ for new parents. During the sessions you will be able to meet key members of the Primary School’s leadership team, find out lots of information about the school and ask myself or my team any questions or raise any concerns that you may have.


Parents are free to attend either session. You do not need to attend both. They are on:


Monday 24th August at 3.30 pm


OR


Tuesday 25th August at 9.00 am


If you would like to sign up for one of the sessions, please fill in your details on the document here (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-DKi2aiyUJFxYMGVagTdli3wSknAi2oX31zv1_HABHA/edit#gid=0) under the date you wish to attend. The Google Meet link required for each session is included underneath the date. Please do not share it outside of our school community.


It would be great to meet as many new parents as possible next week.


Best wishes,


Mr Simon Sharp
