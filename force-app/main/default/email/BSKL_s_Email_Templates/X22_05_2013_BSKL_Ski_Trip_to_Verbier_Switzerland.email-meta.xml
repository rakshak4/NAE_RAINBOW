It will be a trip of a lifetime for your children and a chance to learn how to ski, meet new students from other schools and have a lot of fun. It was in my top 3 trips when went to school. It may seem like a long way to travel for a Ski Trip but the provider has a fantastic reputation, safety standards and excellent customer service. Please complete the electronic form below if you are interested on your participating in the trip child. There is a section for you to state any concerns or provide feedback if you wish to do so regarding the trip. The deadline to complete the show of interest form is June 7th 2013. There are unfortunately limited places for this trip, those who complete the below form first will reserve their places first. If there are not enough students who want to go on the trip then it will not go ahead. We look forward to you support and feedback.
