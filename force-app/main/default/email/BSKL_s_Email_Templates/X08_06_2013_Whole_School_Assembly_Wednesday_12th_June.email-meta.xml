Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We trust this finds you all well.

We would like to invite you to a whole school assembly taking place on Wednesday 12th June at 1pm.  Please note the date and time of this assembly has changed and it will no longer take place on Thursday 13th June.

This assembly will be held to celebrate the great success of last monthâ€™s Ring Pull Collection.

We will have some special visitors and there will be some performances from our students.  Can all students who will be playing in these performances bring in their instruments and blazers on this day.

We hope to see you there.

Thank you and warm regards,

Administration Team
The British International School of Kuala Lumpur
