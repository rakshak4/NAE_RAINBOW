Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName}

At BSKL, we offer a diverse programme of individual instrumental lessons to children from Year 2 upwards. Instrumental lessons currently on offer are:
Piano – starting from YR2
Violin – starting from YR2
Flute – starting from YR5
Clarinet – starting from YR5
Saxophone – starting from YR5
Brass (Trumpet, Tenor Horn, Baritone, Euphonium or Trombone) – starting YR5

Individual lessons are rotated around the school timetable and offered once a week, at a cost of RM75 per lesson. There are normally ten confirmed lessons during term time, each lasting 45 minutes. Lessons begin in the second week of each term and follow through, in most cases, to the penultimate week.
