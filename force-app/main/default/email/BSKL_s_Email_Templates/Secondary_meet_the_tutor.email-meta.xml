Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Please be reminded that the Secondary &apos;Meet the Tutor&apos; event is on Thursday 28th August at 2.00pm. If you have children in Secondary and Primary, you should attend the Primary meeting first (at 1.00pm), and then go on to the Secondary campus. This meeting is for pupils as well.

I look forward to seeing you next week.


Kind regards

Derek Mackey
