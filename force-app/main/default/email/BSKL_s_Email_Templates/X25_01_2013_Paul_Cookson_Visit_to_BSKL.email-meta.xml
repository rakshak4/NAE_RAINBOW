Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Paul Cookson is a children’s poet and performer from the UK. He is a former teacher, illustrator and performer who spends most of his time visiting schools, performing his poetry and helping children to write their own poems.

Paul has visited around 4000 schools from all around the world (and therefore has done over 4000 performances and well over 12,000 workshops!)

Paul will be visiting the primary students of BSKL on Wednesday 30 January. All students from Years 1-5 will watch and participate in an engaging assembly run by Paul from 1-2pm. Selected students from Years 3-5 will participate in a writing session with Paul from 2-3pm where he will help the students to co-write a poem.

To coincide with Paul Cookson’s visit there will be a book sale on Wednesday 30 January from 9am-4pm. Children from Years 1-5 will be given time during the day to purchase the following Paul Cookson books:

It’s behind you RM 34.00

I’d rather be a footballer RM 34.00

Pants on fire RM 28.00

Books can only be purchased with cash and books cannot be reserved and paid for later. There will only be a limited number of books available.

Paul Cookson will be signing books at the school from 3pm-4pm so if parents and children would like to meet Paul he will be at the front reception area. For those children on the bus I will arrange to have their books signed.

It should be a very exciting day for the primary school children at BSKL and we are very fortunate to have someone of Paul’s caliber visit our school. We look forward to your support.

Regards,

Yvonne Bowyer
