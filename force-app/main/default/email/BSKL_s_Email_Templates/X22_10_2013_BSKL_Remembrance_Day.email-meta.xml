Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

BSKL REMEMBRANCE DAY, MONDAY 11TH  NOVEMBER 2013
 
This year’s assembly to commemorate Remembrance Day will be held on Monday 11th November 2013. 
 
In light of the occasion, it has been deemed compulsory for all students from Year 3 to Year 8 to dress formally in the school blazer.  This assembly is for Years 3 to Year 9 students and is a student only service.
 
In the assembly, the student choir will sing ‘Adiemos’.  There will also be a minute’s silence, wreath laying ceremony, Last Post and Reveille.  The assembly is to honour those who have given their lives in past conflicts across the world.
 
Furthermore as a mark of respect for this day BISKL will be offering poppies at both the Primary and Secondary school receptions from Wednesday 23rd October.   A minimum donation of RM 5 for each poppy is politely requested. It would be fantastic if all pupils were wearing a poppy on Remembrance Day. All proceeds raised will go towards The Royal British Legion, a charity that supports past and present servicemen (and women) and their families.  More information about The Royal British Legion can be found in this link. http://www.britishlegion.org.uk/

Warm regards,

Tom Hickman
