Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

This Thursday 10th October we have a professional photographer visiting BSKL to take photographs of the Secondary campus.

For those students that have blazers we would very much appreciate if they could come to school that day wearing their blazer.  It is not compulsory to purchase one should you not have one before this date.

Thank you as always for your cooperation.

Kind Regards,
Administration Team
The British International School of Kuala Lumpur
