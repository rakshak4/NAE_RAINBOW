Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Please find in the link below your invitation for Prize Giving on the last day of term. A large number of pupils will be receiving prizes for attainment and application, and we will also be announcing our Head Boy and Head Girl for 2014 â€“ 2015. Our guest speaker is Mr Giles Duley, an award-winning war photojournalist. I know you will be very moved by his talk. Can you RSVP to azizan.sallehhuddin@britishschool.edu.my so that we can make seating and catering arrangements.

I am also pleased to be able to invite Year 6 pupils and parents. I appreciate that you will have already attended the KS2 Prize Giving, but you are most welcome to join the Secondary event by way of an introduction to your son/daughter&apos;s new school: I would be delighted to see you there.
