    <subject>Welcome to BSKL from the Secondary School Leadership Team</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Welcome to the British International School of Kuala Lumpur.

In this Welcome Letter, you will find some important information regarding your child’s school life.

The school is keen to ensure a smooth transition; on your child’s first day at school, they will be met by their teacher, who will take them to their class. They will be given a class ‘buddy’ who will help and support them in their first few weeks as they become familiar with school routines. You can read how we support new students academically and socially, to ensure they have the best start to their school life at BSKL.

Our school timings are from 7.45am to 3.30pm Monday to Thursday (unless they have an additional after-school activity), and then from 7.45am to 2pm ​​on a Friday.

Please find below further information on key areas, such as uniforms, the parent app and sports club sign ups and more.

We are looking forward to welcoming you all into the BSKL family. We wish you a pleasant beginning to your time with us and our teachers look forward to meeting you in person.

Best wishes,
Secondary School Leadership Team
The British International School of Kuala Lumpur

Meet the Tutor Day
The first day of the new academic year will be Meet The Tutor Day. This will take place on Monday, 24 August. Currently we plan to have this meeting virtually.

This is an important start to the new academic year as it provides an opportunity for you to meet with your child&apos;s form tutor to discuss your child&apos;s academic progress, their hopes and aims for the year ahead. It is also an important time to receive key information about the class and school routines. Your child’s tutors will email you on the 19th August with details of the appointment time and how to join the meeting virtually.  Meetings will last approximately 20 minutes.

On Tuesday, 25 August, we will begin the new timetable for all year groups. We are currently modelling a full return to school following the Malaysian Government&apos;s announcement that schools will re-open beginning 21 July. However we will be planning for additional scenarios including a partial return to school or our virtual school experience.

Parent Welcome &amp; Information Sessions - September 2020
We look forward to welcoming you to the parent events which will take place throughout the year. All details will be on the calendar in our BSKL Parent App - the main ones for the first few weeks of term are listed below and currently these are planned to be virtual events:

KS5 Information Session: Tuesday, 1 September, 3.45 to 4.30pm
KS4 Information Session: Wednesday, 2 September, 3.45 to 4.30pm
KS3 Information Session: Thursday, 3 September, 3.45 to 4.30pm

The above events will focus on the pastoral, academic and wider provisions at BSKL. Further details will be issued in August.

New Parent Coffee Morning on 9 September
We would like to invite you for our new parents coffee morning, on Wednesday, 9 September from 8 to 10am where we hope to get to know you better and answer any queries.

Again, currently this is planned to be a virtual event, but we are hopeful that we can meet in person. We will confirm details in August.

School Uniforms
Please note the uniform shop is open 9.30am to 4pm, Mondays through Thursdays and from 9.30am to 2pm on Fridays beginning on 13 July.

The uniform shop is located at the Upper Hill Campus. Upon arrival, please report to Front Desk initially who will guide you where to go. Strict SOPs from the Malaysian government will be in place, including the need for all guests to complete the Travel and Health Declaration form before arrival and to log their temperature on the online form for campus visitors upon arrival. Masks should be worn and social distancing in place within the store.

Please contact Mr Steven at steven@l-vince.com if you have any questions regarding the uniform shop or refer to the school&apos;s website.

The uniform shop is in the process of opening an online store where you can place uniform orders and collect them in the shop. The Admissions Office will share more details about this when the online shop is ready.

Parent ID tag
You will be provided a parent ID tag and a car sticker to allow your entrance into the school. Please note that a current school ID tag must be worn at all times while in school.

If you haven&apos;t already please send a passport-size photo to admissions@britishschool.edu.my for your ID. You will be able to collect your ID from the Lower Hill Campus Front Desk, when you come to purchase/pick up your uniform if you&apos;ve submitted your photo in advance.

Secondary Parent Handbook
The Secondary Parent Handbook 2020 can be found on our website and is via this link, for ease of access.

Bus Information
In order to book a seat, please see our bus routes on our web page and reach out to the contact stated. Please note that places are dependent on availability. The bus service will commence on 25 August.

BSKL Parent App
The BSKL Parent App is a smart phone app to provide parents with an &apos;in the palm of your hand&apos; bespoke communication tool.

Each parent/guardian can have access to the App, by simply downloading it from the relevant store (search for BSKL Parent App). To register for the App, please follow the instructions in this document.

For any questions relating to the app, please contact the Parent App Liaison Officer, at portal@britishschool.edu.my

Lunches
Nutritious school lunches will be provided according to the local guidelines and compliance with Malaysia’s Covid-19 prevention measures. Ordinarily, a hot lunch is served to all students in school, but we’re still awaiting government guidelines related to food preparation on campus.

School lunches are paid for in advance along with tuition fees. If you have not already informed the school that your child has dietary restrictions (whether for health, religious or allergy reasons), please do so immediately. We will inform the school kitchen and special arrangements will be made to provide proper suitable alternatives.

There is a coffee bar available and pupils are able to buy healthy snacks and drinks at published times.

Nut Free School
Please be advised that the school is a nut-free zone. Some children have severe allergies to peanuts in particular. No products containing any nuts whatsoever are allowed within the school premises.

Private Music Lessons
In addition to the Music Curriculum which consists of whole-class music and Group Instrumental Lessons (PIPs and SIPs), BSKL supports a diverse Individual Instrumental Programme for students in Year 2 and above. These lessons are focused on encouraging students who have a particular enjoyment of playing music, to develop their interests and studies further. More information on the programme can be found on our website here. Registration for the programme opens before the start of each term.
