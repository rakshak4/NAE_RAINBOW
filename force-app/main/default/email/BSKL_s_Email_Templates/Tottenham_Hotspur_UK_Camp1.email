Dear Parents,
 
Firstly I would like to welcome you all to the BSKL family!  We look forward to seeing you all in September. 
 
BSKL is thrilled to announce an truly once in a lifetime opportunity for budding footballers out there!
 
The British International School in association with Tottenham Hotspur and Football Focus Asia, is presenting the opportunity for students to travel to the UK and spend a week at Tottenham Hotspur football club having professional coaching sessions, visiting the Tottenham Hotspur lodge (training ground), White Hart Lane and last but certainly not least a visit to the famous Wembley Stadium! 
 
It promises to be an action packed week with an wonderful array of activities scheduled.  The schedule of the week is attached.
 
Details of the camp are as follows:
 
Dates: arriving on Sunday 9th Septemver and departing on Saturday 15th September back to KL.
Flights: with either Etihad or Emirates
Accommodation: –  5* accommodation at the Marriot Hotel at Waltham Abbey!  This is full board sharing on a twin basis.
Itinerary: Full itinerary of activities on a daily basis (itinerary is attached)
Student Age: Group 1: 9 – 12 years old (10 students) and Group 2: 13 – 16 years old (10 students)
No of students: 20 students

The maximum number of students that are able to participate in this fantastic opportunity is 20 only.  They will be accompanied by a member of Football Focus Asia and also Mr. Harrie Thomson, the BSKL Head of PE.  It is a strictly a first come first served basis. 
 
Should any parent wish to go on the trip that is no problem at all.  However you will need to make your own arrangements for the trip.  This includes flights, hotel arrangements and visits to White Hart Lane and Wembley stadium.  You will also be required to find your own way by means of transport and also look into respective entry fees – where applicable.  Parents are not allowed to enter into the Tottenham first team training facilities – i.e. the Tottenham Hotspur Lodge.
 
If you wish to sign up please follow the below steps:
 
1)      Fill in the attached registration form and hand it into the reception at BSKL or email it toTottenham.registration@britishschool.edu.my no later than Friday 24th August. 
2)      Once all registrations are in, the school will then contact you confirming your child(ren) have made the list of 20 students for the camp.  The school will request for the payment arrangements.  The payment deadline is Monday 3rd September.  If after this time the payment has not been received the place will be forfeited. 
 
I would like to politely add that no refunds are given once students officially sign up for the camp.
 
This sort of opportunity does not come around every day and we are very happy to be able to offer this incredible experience to our students!
 
Should you have any questions please do not hesitate to get in touch.
 
Kind Regards,
