Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

I trust this finds you all well.

As you know on Saturday 23rd March The Pet Project will be taking place in school from 9am â€“ 6pm.  It promises to be a wonderful and worthwhile event, with something for everyone!

In accordance with this event on Friday 22nd March we would like to invite students to come to school in their own clothing.  This optional Non-Uniform Day will raise funds for The Pet Project.  If your child would like to come to school in their own clothes then please make a donation of RM5 to their class teacher on the day.

Thank you and warm regards

Administration Team
The British International School of Kuala Lumpur
