Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName}

Year 4 Curriculum – Term 3



We hope you had a relaxing holiday and are pleased to see the children have headed back to school refreshed and eager to learn.   We have a busy term ahead and have lots of exciting topics for the children to learn about.



At BSKL, we run a literacy-based, thematic curriculum with the children studying a different theme each term. This term, we will be focusing on ‘Amazing Aztecs and the Discovery of Chocolate’ and this will run across many of the subjects we will be teaching in class.  As last term, the English, mathematics and science curriculum we teach is in line with the new English National Curriculum.



English



We will be learning about different types of writing, including advertisements and persuasive texts, performance poetry and writing stories which include a dilemma.  We will be using the popular novel ‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’ by Roald Dahl to link our English work with our theme. The children will continue to have a differentiated weekly session dedicated to spelling, punctuation and grammar, although these areas will also be covered in our daily literacy lessons.  The children will also continue to take part in regular guided reading sessions.



Mathematics



The children will have daily maths lessons ensuring that all aspects of mathematics curriculum are covered during the year.  This term they will be building on areas covered in the last two terms, looking at: fractions, decimals and percentages, data handling (pie charts, bar graphs and line graphs), ratio, algebra, as well as consolidating their number work (written and mental strategies for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division). To improve their mathematical fluency, the children will also be aiming to improve their knowledge of times tables and corresponding division facts through weekly challenges.



Science



Our science topics this term are States of Matter and Sound.  The children will learn about solids, liquids and gases and the processes that bring about the changes between them, namely melting, freezing, condensation and evaporation. Investigations will be a key part of the learning process and the children will also be cooking to gain some practical experience of these changes of state.  With regards to our unit on Sound, the pupils will explore vibrations, pitch and volume and investigate how effective soundproofing can be brought about.



Computing



This term the children will learn about robotics.  They are very excited about the arrival of our new class robotic trolleys and are keen to start making their own robot models.  Nearer the end of the year, we will also give the children an introduction to animation. We will continue to use iPads to enhance all areas of the curriculum.



Topic



Using the Aztec myth of ‘The Snake and the Eagle’ as a stimulus, the children will investigate the Aztec civilisation. Our studies will include the ancient city of Tenochtitlan, religious beliefs and daily life. In addition, we will be using Aztec art as a stimulus to produce some block prints. We will finish by learning about the Spanish invasion and the impact this had on the Aztecs. Chocolate was an Aztec discovery and we will be learning more about this during the second half of this term.



MFL



Year 4 children will continue studying either Mandarin or Spanish.  Mandarin lessons are differentiated by ability due to the wide range of competency amongst our children.  This term Mandarin lessons will be covering the following topics:



Basic: Food and Beverage, School and Uniform, Stationery and My House

Beginner: Time and Routine, Food and Beverage, Transportation and Hobbies

Elementary: Fast food and Desserts, Healthy food, Transportation and Currency



In Spanish, the children will be covering a number of short topics: Sports and Hobbies, Animals  (farm and wild animals), Food, Time (including daily routines) and Summer Festivals in Spain. Throughout the topic work they will be incorporating lots of new vocabulary and using songs, role play, stories and creative activities to continue to develop the children&apos;s speaking, reading and writing skills in Spanish.



Malaysian children will continue to study Bahasa. Topics for Term 3 include Places in Town and Occupations.



Music



The children will continue to learn how to play an instrument in our Primary Instrumental Programme (PIPs) lessons from the choice of violin, viola or cello. During class music lessons, the children will be covering the following topics: Painting With Sound and Salt, Pepper, Vinegar, Mustard.  In these topics, the children will explore sound and musical signals.



PE



In PE, the Year 4 children will continue with their swimming lessons on the same day that they had it in Term 2.  In their other two lessons, they will be introduced to Outdoor and Adventurous Activities (OAA), which will include using the climbing wall/bouldering area, team building and orienteering activities.  They will also play tag rugby and continue with badminton, as they only completed a short block last term.  Closer to their Sports Day they will re-visit athletics for a couple of weeks to prepare them for this event.  They may also get the opportunity to take part in ‘Games Making’, which involves designing their own games that could be taught to younger pupils.



Homework



Homework tasks remain the same as last term. In Year 4, the children will be given two pieces of homework each week; each piece should take approximately 30 minutes.  One piece will be English (or topic) and one piece will be Mathematics. All children at BSKL are also encouraged to read daily. On a Tuesday, children will also bring home a list of spellings, which will be assessed the following week.  The children will also need to continue practising times tables, and corresponding division facts for their weekly challenge. The Modern Foreign Language (MFL) team (Mandarin or Spanish), will also be setting a weekly piece of homework.



All children have personal accounts with two websites the school subscribes to:  MyMaths and Education City.  Login details can be found in your child’s homework book.  Homework may be set on these sites occasionally.



Events to look forward to include:



Thursday 11th June Primary Open Day

Friday, 12th June  KS2 Parent’s ‘Coffee and Chat’

Monday, 15th  June Year 3 &amp; 4 Sports Day



Each Year 4 class will continue to share with you what has been happening in class via the class Parent Portal blogs. Any changes to normal school routine or important dates or events will be shared with you via the school calendar and we encourage parents to check the Parent Portal calendar regularly.



For safeguarding purposes, can we ask that adults wear their identification tags at all times within school and if your child is due to be collected by someone else, please do inform us in advance.



I hope this letter gives you a brief insight into what your child will be learning this term. As always, if you have any questions or concerns please contact your class teacher as a first point of contact.



Kind regards,



Year 4 Team
