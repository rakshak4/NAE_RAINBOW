Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We would like to invite you all to a transition morning taking place next week.  This is essentially a ‘moving up’ session whereby your children and yourselves get to meet your new teachers. For those teachers who have not arrived in KL yet, your child will see a PowerPoint presentation on their teacher.

It is on Thursday 11th July from 8 – 9.30am.  Please inform us by Tuesday if your child will be attending.

Kind Regards,

Administration Team
The British International School of Kuala Lumpur
