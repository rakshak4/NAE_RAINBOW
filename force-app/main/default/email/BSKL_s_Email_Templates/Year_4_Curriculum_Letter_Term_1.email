The children have all settled in very well after the holiday. We have a busy year ahead with lots of exciting topics for the children to learn about.</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;">At BSKL, we run a literacy-based thematic curriculum with the children studying a different theme each term. This term, we will be focusing on <i><b>Ancient Egypt</b></i> and this will run across many of the subjects we will be teaching in class. The English, mathematics and science curriculum we teach is in line with the new English National Curriculum.</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><b><u>English</u></b></div><div style="margin: 0px;">The children will be learning about and composing different types of texts including Myths and Legends, Autobiographies and Biographies, Information texts and Narrative. We will be using the popular novel, “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” by Roald Dahl and the Aztec myth of “How Music Came To The World”, to link our English work with our topic. The children will have lessons in Spelling, Punctuation and Grammar (SPaG); these will be an integral part of the daily English lessons. They will also participate in regular guided reading sessions.</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><u><b>Mathematics</b></u></div><div style="margin: 0px;">The children will have five hours of mathematics lessons each week, ensuring that all aspects of the mathematics curriculum are covered during the year. We will be using the new Mathematics Mastery approach to ensure that the children achieve a deep understanding of the concepts they are learning. This term they will be learning about Number &amp; Place Value, Addition &amp; Subtraction, Multiplication &amp; Division, Time, Area &amp; Perimeter. To improve their mathematical fluency, the children will also be aiming to improve their knowledge of time tables and corresponding division facts through various challenges.</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><u><b>Science</b></u></div><div style="margin: 0px;">Our science topics this term are Sound and States of Matter. Within the unit on Sound, children will learn about vibrations, pitch, volume and investigate effective soundproofing. During the States of Matter unit, children will learn about solids, liquids, gases and the process that brings about changes between them. Investigations, as well as the acquisition of knowledge, will be a key part in the learning process.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><b><u>Computing</u></b></div><div style="margin: 0px;">This term all children in Year 4 will receive their own iPad mini. Children will spend time getting to know their iPad and the various apps that they will use across the curriculum. Within Computing, children will also be learning about E-Safety, iMovies and animation.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><u><b>Topic</b></u></div><div style="margin: 0px;">Our topic this term is the Aztecs and Chocolate. There will be strong cross curricular links between the topic and English. We will use Aztec myths and videos as a stimulus for children to investigate the Aztec civilisation. Our studies will include the ancient city of Tenochtitlan, religious beliefs and daily life. We will use Aztec art as a stimulus to produce masks and pottery. Chocolate was an Aztec discovery and we will be learning more about this during the second half of this term.</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><b><u>Modern Foreign Languages (MFL)</u></b></div><div style="margin: 0px;">Year 4 children will continue to study either Mandarin or Spanish.

On their swimming lesson day, they will come to school in their uniform, not PE kit. On their PE days, they will come in dressed in their PE kit and remain in it for the whole day. During their PE lessons, over the course of the term and the start of term 2, they will take part in the following activities: &nbsp;benchball, football, tag rugby, gymnastics, athletics and Outdoor Adventure Activity (OAA). &nbsp;These activities will be rotated throughout the term, so that all groups take part in all activities. The children will be grouped by ability and will be continuously assessed throughout the term, in order that we can move pupils accordingly. We will spend the first two weeks of term 1 assessing the pupils in various sports, to create the PE groups.</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><b><u>Homework</u></b></div><div style="margin: 0px;">The children will be given two pieces of homework each week; each piece should take approximately 30 minutes. One piece will be English/topic related and the other will be mathematics. All children at BSKL are encouraged to read daily, this will need to be recorded in the Reading Record. On Friday, children will have a spelling homework where they will investigate spelling patterns. These will be assessed the following Friday where the words will be used in context. The children will also need to continue practising times tables and corresponding division facts. In addition, children will receive a weekly homework activity from their Mandarin or Spanish teacher.</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><u><b>Events to look forward to this term:</b></u></div><div style="margin: 0px;">17th September - Y4 Parent’s iPad meeting</div><div style="margin: 0px;">22nd September - Parent’s Y4 Residential meeting</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;">Each year 4 class will continue to share with you what is happening in class via the class portal blogs. Any changes to normal school routine or important dates/events will be shared via the school calendar. Although a notification e-mail may be sent, we encourage parents to check the Parent Portal calendar regularly.</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;">For safeguarding purposes, can we ask that adults wear their identification tags at all times within school and if your child is due to be collected by someone else, please do inform us in advance.</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;">I hope this letter gives you a brief insight into what your child will be learning this term.
