Message from the Head of Secondary

Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We are now officially open! Many of you will have been immensely impressed, proud, and moved, by the music, singing and speaking during our Opening Ceremony. It was certainly a proud moment for me, and for all of the BSKL staff. If you were unable to attend the ceremony I would strongly recommend that look at the professionally produced video that will be available soon.

It seems incredible that there are now only five weeks to go until we break up for Christmas – how the time has flown. This is typically the time when pupils become tired, and, sometimes, ill. Please help your children by ensuring they get plenty of sleep over the next few weeks. We understand that pupils are sometimes ill, and this is built into our planning, as is time for trips and enrichment. We are of course perfectly happy to support pupils when they are unwell by organising for work to be sent home. I also understand that there occasions when unforeseen circumstances mean pupils have to rake time away from school. I am a little disappointed that I am still receiving requests for what often appear to be extended holidays or family gatherings – I do believe that these absences, on top of the other circumstances when pupils may be away, do have a detrimental impact on your child’s learning. I have said before that there are 170 days in the year when pupils do not have to be in school: please arrange to take your holiday during this period. In principle, I will not ask staff to send work home for pupils that take extended holiday, and such absences will be recorded as unauthorised by the school.

You may recall that earlier in the year I wrote about reviewing the House system. The first phase of this change is now firmly embedded, as pupils meet as a House/Tutor Group each day and have PSHE and Academic Tutorials together each week. This makes the Tutor the lynchpin of your child’s education at BSKL. The awarding of certificates for Progress Reviews and for Excellence Slips, on an individual and house basis has kick-started our inter-house completion. The Key Stage 3 football competitions starting in a couple of weeks will get our house sport underway.  We also discussed the possibility of changing the names of the Secondary Houses, in order to create a greater sense of secondary identity. After some lengthy discussion and research with pupils and staff we have decided that the initial reasons for changing the names of the houses have, perhaps, dissipated: pupils have settled very quickly into the new campus and the secondary section is very clearly defined. For now at least we have decided to remain with the current nomenclature (Romans, Saxons, Normans and Vikings), although pupils will have the opportunity to revisit this aspect of school organisation when we form our School Council after Christmas. My sense is very much that we now have a healthy house system that will allow all of our pupils to flourish and provide an excellent vehicle for competitive activities.

Notices
