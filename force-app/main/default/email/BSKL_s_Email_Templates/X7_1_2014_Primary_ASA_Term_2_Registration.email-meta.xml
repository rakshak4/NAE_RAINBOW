Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

For After School Activities (ASA) this term, we are using an online sign up system whereby you will sign up for your child’s choice of ASA.

The online sign up system will be available from
6pm Thursday 9th January

Please only sign up for 1 ASA on a Tuesday and 1 ASA on a Thursday making sure the ASA is specifically for your aged child. If your child is training for a school sports team or in the Rainbows or Brownies then they don’t need to sign up for another ASA on that day.

If the ASA is already filled up, you will be informed immediately and will then have the option to sign up for a second choice.

Once a student is signed up to an ASA, I expect them to commit to that ASA all term and there will be no option to change to another ASA.

Early Years children who get the bus and need to wait for their sibling can join our creche. There are a limited number of paid ASAs available for Reception age.

For detailed descriptions of the ASAs, please click on the link below to go to the information booklet:
