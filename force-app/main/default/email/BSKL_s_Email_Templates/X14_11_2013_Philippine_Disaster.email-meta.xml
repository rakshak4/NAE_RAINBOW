Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Please note that majority of donations have been boxed and delivered this morning to the Philippine Embassy. Therefore no need for those parents who plan to come to the school this afternoon (3pm to 4pm was specified in yesterdayâ€™s letter) that is not required.

However some donations are expected this afternoon so if they are here at the school and want to help they can ask if anything needs to be done.

Kind Regards
The Event and Fundraising Committee

Administration Team
