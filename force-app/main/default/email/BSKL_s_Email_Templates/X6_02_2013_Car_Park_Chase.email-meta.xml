Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

The BSKL Fun Run 2013
The Car Park Chase
March 10, 10 am race start

Entry forms for the individual and team races can be collected from the school reception.  Entries and fee must be returned by Friday 16 February.  No late entries will be accepted as we need to know numbers so that we can provide runners with a race t-shirt.

The winner of the race logo design competition will be announced at assembly on Monday 18 February.  Thank you to everyone who entered, what great imaginations our children have!

Any questions email, lynfenby@hotmail.com

Regards,
Administration Team
