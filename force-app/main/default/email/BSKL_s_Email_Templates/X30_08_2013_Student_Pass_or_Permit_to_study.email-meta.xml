Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Going forward a Student pass or Permit to Study is legally required for all expatriat children studying in an international school except for those that are permanent residents of Malaysia and thus hold a residence pass or children of Diplomats.

Essentially a permit to study is for children whose parents have a work permit or MM2H status, and a student pass for those who don&apos;t.

PERMIT TO STUDY

Applicable for children who hold a Dependent pass and whose   parent/parents are working in Malaysia and children under the Malaysia My Second Home Programme (MM2H).

Application for Permit to study can only be obtained after a Dependent Pass has been issued to the child or the child has obtained MM2H status.

Permit to study is a &apos;stamp&apos; given by Immigration and states the child is allowed to study in an international school (such as BSKL) for a defined period of time (this corresponds to the duration of the Dependent Pass and would need to be renewed accordingly).

The processing period to obtain this pass is generally short and can be obtained from the Immigration department at Putrajaya.

STUDENT PASS

Applicable to only those who hold a Social Visit Pass only.  They are not entitled to apply for a Permit to Study.
The processing period to obtain a Student Pass is up to 2 weeks and would need to be renewed accordingly.

Any expatriat child who does not hold either a Permit to study or a Student pass who are involved in school trips outside of Malaysia may face problems at immigration at points of exit/entry.

You may wish to engage an agent to help you with the process.  By clicking on the below link you will find contact details of two agencies that are able to provide this service.

Upon request the school will provide any relevant documentation required to support the applications.

Once you have obtained your child/children&apos;s Permit to Study or Student Pass please pass a copy to the school admissions department.

Children will of course still be able to come to school as normal while you or your company is going through the student permit process.

Kind Regards,
