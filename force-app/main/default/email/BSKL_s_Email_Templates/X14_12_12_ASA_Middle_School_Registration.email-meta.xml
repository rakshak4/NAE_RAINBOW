Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Below are links for the ASA Middle School Registration form and Middle School ASA Information Handbook. Please see the instructions below for completing the forms:

1.    Decide which ASA you would like your children to do from the
       information provided in the ASA Information Handbook.
2.    Click on the ‘Registration Form’ link below.
3.    Fill out all of the information and click on the drop down box to see
all of the ASA’s for the whole week.
4.    The order of ASA’s will be Tuesdays, Thursdays, Monday,
Wednesday and finally Friday’s.
5.    Only register your child for one ASA for each of the above days.
6.    You will then receive confirmation via email telling you whether your
child has been enrolled or put on the waitlist for that ASA.
7.    If you receive an email saying your child is on the wait list then
please submit another registration form with your child’s 2nd choice
for that day.
8. You must submit separate forms for each ASA’s you wish to register
your child in. For example if you would like them to do 1 ASA on
Tuesday and 1 ASA on Thursday you would have to submit 2 forms,
