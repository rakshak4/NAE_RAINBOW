Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

BSKL Triathlon Team

A fantastic opportunity has arisen for BSKL to enter a team of pupils into the Alice Smith School Triathlon on Saturday 13th April.  Below are the details of age groups and distances for the swim, cycle and run.  If you child is interested in entering please register them using the hyperlink below.

On the 13th April Mrs Lambros and Mrs Townend will be at The Alice Smith School to meet with children from BSKL and support and encourage any children who have entered.  Children will need to make their own way to and from the event but we invite all BSKL children to meet with us at the event to create a sense of team spirit and excitement.  We would also encourage all children from BSKL to compete in their BSKL sports kit.

We hope to see a good turn out from BSKL to build on our outstanding performance in Penang and our very successful sports teams.
