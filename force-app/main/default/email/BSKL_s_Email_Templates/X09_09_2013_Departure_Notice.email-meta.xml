Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We trust this finds you well and that your child has settled into the new academic year.

Please note if you plan on withdrawing your child from BSKL at the end of Term One please inform the school administration team by Friday 13th September in order to be eligible for the Early Notice Payback.

In order to be eligible for the Early Notice Payback we request that families provide 90 days notice of a childâ€™s departure.  Term One comes to an end on Friday 13th December 2013 therefore the eligibility deadline is Friday 13th September 2013.

If you require any further information or assistance on this matter please do not hesitate to contact a member of the school administration team.

Thank you and warm regards,

Administration Team
The British International School of Kuala Lumpur
World Class Education
