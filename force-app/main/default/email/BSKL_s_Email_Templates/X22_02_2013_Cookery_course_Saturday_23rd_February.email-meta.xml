Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We are very much looking forward to tomorrow&apos;s cookery course. Just a reminder to say, please be at school with your child between 8 and 8.15am for an 8.30am departure.

Children may wear their home play clothes.

We anticipate that we will be back at school at 1.30pm. Please could you ensure that you are here on time, to pick up your child.

With kind regards

Tom Hickman and Blandine Pouchard

Regards,
Administration Team
