    <subject>Welcome to BSKL from the Head of Primary School</subject>
    <textOnly>Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Welcome to the British International School of Kuala Lumpur.

Our school values developing the whole child- academically, pastorally and socially with the principles of Positive Education underpinning our approach. With the child at the centre of our decision making we believe that we are best-placed to offer an outstanding education for all students in our care.

BSKL has been graded as excellent in all areas of educational provision by the Independent Schools Inspectorate, and is a member of Nord Anglia Education. At Nord Anglia Education, we work every day to inspire our students, schools and employees to be the best they can be and we are ambitious for them all to achieve more than they thought possible in their personal, social and academic endeavours. Within our family of schools, this aspiration is underpinned by a commitment to always act with respect, integrity, openness and courage.

The school is keen to ensure a smooth transition; on your child’s first day at school, they will be met by their Teacher, who will take them to their class. They will be given a class ‘buddy’ who will help and support them in their first few weeks as they become familiar with school routines. You can read how we support them academically and socially, to ensure they have the best start to their school life at BSKL.

Our school timings are from 7.45am to 3.30pm Monday to Thursday (unless they have an additional after-school activity), and then from 7.45am to 2pm ​​on a Friday.

From your child’s teacher, you will receive information about the timing of specialist lessons. Every child is also given a house (Normans, Romans, Saxons or Vikings) and will have the chance to participate in a number of house events during the course of the academic year.

Please find below further information on key areas, such as the parent app and sports club sign ups can be found below.

We are looking forward to welcoming you all into the BSKL family. We wish you a pleasant beginning to your time with us and I look forward to meeting you in person.

Kind regards,

Mr Simon Sharp
Head of Primary School

Meet the Tutor Day
The first day of the new academic year will be Meet The Teacher Day. This will take place on Monday, 24 August. Currently we plan to have this meeting virtually.

This is an important start to the new academic year as it provides an opportunity for you to meet with your child&apos;s form tutor to discuss your child&apos;s academic progress, their hopes and aims for the year ahead. It is also an important time to receive key information about the class and school routines. A sign up sheet will be circulated before the start of term

On Tuesday, 25 August, we will begin the new timetable for all year groups. We are currently modelling a full return to school following the Malaysian Government&apos;s announcement that schools will reopen beginning 21 July. However we will be planning for additional scenarios including a partial return to school or our virtual school experience.

Parent Welcome &amp; Information Sessions - September 2020
We will welcome all parents to our school for our Parent Welcome and Information Session which will take place during the first week of school. This will be held on either of two dates:

Monday, 24 August 2020 at 3.30pm at the of Meet the Teacher Day (if we have to hold the meeting virtually)
Tuesday, 25 August 2020 at 8.30am just after you have dropped your child off to their new class (if we are able to hold the meeting in the school building)

We will confirm with you one week in advance which date we opt for and this will depend on the prevailing advice from the Ministry of Education or Ministry of Health at the Time.

School Uniforms
Please note the uniform shop is open 9.30am to 4pm, Mondays through Thursdays and from 9.30am to 2pm on Fridays beginning on 13 July.

The uniform shop is located at the Upper Hill Campus. Upon arrival, please report to Front Desk initially who will guide you where to go. Strict SOP&apos;s from the Malaysian government will be in place, including the need for all guests to complete the Travel and Health Declaration form before arrival and to log their temperature on the online form for campus visitors upon arrival. Masks should be worn and social distancing in place within the store.

Please contact Mr Steven at steven@l-vince.com if you have any questions regarding the uniform shop or refer to the school&apos;s website.

The uniform shop is in the process of opening an online store where you can place uniform orders and collect them in the shop. The Admissions Office will share more details about this when the online shop is ready.

Bus Information
In order to book a seat, please see our bus routes on our web page and reach out to the contact stated. Please note that places are dependent on availability. The bus service will commence on the 25th August

BSKL Parent App
The BSKL Parent App is a smart phone App to provide parents with an “in the palm of your hand” bespoke communication tool.

Each parent/guardian can have access to the App, by simply downloading it from the relevant store (search for BSKL Parent App). To register for the App, please follow the instructions in this document.

For any questions relating to the app, please contact the Parent App Liaison Officer, at portal@britishschool.edu.my

Schools Buddy - Enrichment and after school club App
Schools Buddy is a leading cloud based App, designed for parents to sign up for Enrichments, after school clubs and monitor sporting events. Soon, you will receive an email prompting you to sign up to Schools Buddy. Please find here guidance on how to sign up.

Lunches
Nutritious school lunches will be provided according to the local guidelines and compliance with Malaysia’s Covid-19 prevention measures. Ordinarily, a hot lunch is served to all students in school, but we’re still awaiting government guidelines related to food preparation on campus.

School lunches are paid for in advance along with tuition fees. If you have not already informed the school that your child has dietary restrictions (whether for health, religious or allergy reasons), please do so immediately. We will inform the school kitchen and special arrangements will be made to provide proper suitable alternatives.

If your child is in Pre-Nursery, Nursery or Reception, you will need to choose which lunch options you would like your child to have. Ms Kanmani, PA to the Head of Primary will share this with you as soon as it is available.

If your child is in Year 1 to Year 6, your child will choose their own lunch with the supervision of their teachers. You do not need to complete a choice form for them.

Nut Free School
Please be advised that the school is a nut-free zone. Some children have severe allergies to peanuts in particular. No products containing any nuts whatsoever are allowed within the school premises.

Parent ID tag
You will be provided a parent ID tag and a car sticker to allow your  entrance into the school. Please note that current school ID tags must be worn at all times when entering the school.

Private Music Lessons
In addition to the Music Curriculum which consists of whole-class music and Group Instrumental Lessons (PIPs and SIPs), BSKL supports a diverse Individual Instrumental Programme for students in Year 2 and above. These lessons are focused on encouraging students who have a particular enjoyment of playing music, to develop their interests and studies further. More information on the programme can be found on our website here. Registration for the programme opens before the start of each term.
