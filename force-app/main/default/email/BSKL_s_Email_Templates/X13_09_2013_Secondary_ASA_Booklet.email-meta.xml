Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Our secondary students will be making the choices for their After School Activities during Tuesday morning registration. Please find attached the ASA Information Guide which outlines the fantastic range of activities on offer this term. I would be very grateful if you could take some time to read through the activities with your children in order for them to make an informed choice on Tuesday. We would encourage all of our students to take up more than one ASA.

Should you have an queries then please contact me on simon.major@britishschool.edu.my
