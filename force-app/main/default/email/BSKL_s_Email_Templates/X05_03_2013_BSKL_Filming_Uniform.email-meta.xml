Please note that commencing on Wednesday 6th March 2013 we will have a film crew in school.   This film crew will be filming footage to be used in a video for The British Schools Foundation.  The video will represent the daily lives of students in our schools.

We will be  filming all aspects of life here at The British International School of Kuala Lumpur.  Please see below for more information on the filming schedule:

  - Foundation Stage will be filmed on Wednesday 6th and Thursday 7th March
  - Sports throughout the school will be filmed on Thursday 7th and Friday 8th March

Please ensure that during these periods your child brings their school blazer in to school.  On days that your child has PE, please ensure they come into school in their uniform, bringing their PE kit in their bag.  They will then be given time to change into their PE kits before their lesson.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation and should you require any further information please contact your Class Teacher or a member of the administration team.
