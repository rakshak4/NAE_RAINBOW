There have been great sporting successes, impressive performances and many inspiring moments in addition to the ongoing academic progress of every student. Achievements in many areas continue to surpass expectations in ways that make us all very proud of our pupils and staff.</div><div><br></div><div>The support of the parent body is, of course, essential to this success and the Board would like to take this opportunity to express our gratitude for the vital contribution made by parents to the school. We appreciate that sending a child to BSKL requires a significant financial effort and we very much hope you feel that this is being rewarded.</div><div><br></div><div>Some parents have raised questions during the course of the year about our fees and I would like to take this opportunity to try to reinforce our common understanding regarding the mission of our school and how this affects fees.</div><div><br></div><div>As you are aware, fees increase every year. We appreciate that parents do not want to feel as if they are exposed to arbitrary increases. It is therefore important to clarify that fee increases at BSKL are carefully considered. Fees are increased to compensate for rising costs (including inflation and exceptionally, the impact of new taxes).</div><div><br></div><div>It is also worth noting that fees tend to be higher in older year groups to reflect higher costs that result from more specialised teaching and lower student-teacher ratios. This is not particular to BSKL but common to independent schools.</div><div><br></div><div>In general, fees at BSKL reflect our ambition to be the very best school not only in KL, but in the region. This has a number of implications. We have smaller class sizes than other schools. We have a dedicated teaching assistant in every primary class, whereas other schools have them only in the youngest age groups. We offer high quality programmes that go beyond standard day to day classroom teaching. This means more specialist coaches, more music and language teachers, who are able to provide better and more personalised education for all pupils, not just the lucky or talented few.</div><div><br></div><div>An additional fact that is often forgotten is that BSKL has at least 10 more teaching days per year than other international schools, which is part of what allows us to do so many extra programmes without compromising academic performance.</div><div><br></div><div>It is a point of pride for the school that in spite of all the extra we offer, our fees remain broadly in line with those of other international schools, which is no small feat.</div><div><br></div><div>This has been achieved in large part because all fees collected by BSKL to date have been spent and reinvested in the school. This will continue into the foreseeable future as the school grows and develops. The principle that the welfare of the school takes precedence over all financial matters is enshrined in the British Schools Foundation's School Charter, shared by all BSF schools around the world. BSKL is no exception.</div><div><br></div><div>The Board of Governors, school management and staff are wholly committed to making BSKL an exceptional educational institution. We have an exemplary student body that continually make us all proud with their character and achievements. We feel fortunate to have a committed body of parents who support us as we strive for excellence.</div><div><br></div><div>After yet another banner year, a well earned break is in sight for our pupils and staff. I would like to take this opportunity to wish you all a pleasant summer and fruitful break ahead of next year when we will be looking to reach new heights under the exceptional leadership of our Head, Mrs Brock.</div><div><br></div><div>With best wishes,</div><div><br></div><div>Stewart Fry</div><div>Chairman of the Board of Governors</div></font></div></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: left;"><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><font size="3">The British Schools Foundation</font><br></font></div></div></div></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><i><font class="Apple-style-span" color="#ff6600"><b>World Class Education</b></font></i></span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><i><font class="Apple-style-span" color="#ff6600"><b><br></b></font></i></span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif">___________________________________________________________</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: center;"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Arial, sans-serif; font-size: x-small; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: auto; text-align: center; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 1; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">{!User.School_List_Email_Footer__c}</span></div>]]></td>
