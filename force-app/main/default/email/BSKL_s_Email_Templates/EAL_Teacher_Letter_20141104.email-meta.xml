Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

I am writing to let you know that we now have a new EAL teacher, since Sam Hywoodâ€™s departure at the end of October.

Suzanne McLaughlin is an experienced teaching assistant, with Teaching English as a Foreign Language (TEFL) training. She has been liaising closely with Mrs Hywood and Mrs Mackey, as well as the class teachers, to ensure she has a good understanding of the needs of each child.

I know she is looking forward to working with the children and will be using the Parent Portal to keep you up-to-date with their learning each week.

If you would like to contact her, her email address is:

suzanne.mclaughlin@britishschool.edu.my

Thank you for your continued support,


Kind Regards,

Debra Birchall
Head of Primary
