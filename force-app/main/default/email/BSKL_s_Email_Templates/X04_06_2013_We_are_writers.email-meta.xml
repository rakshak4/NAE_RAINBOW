Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

The Primary and Middle school editions of &apos;We are writers&apos; have now arrived. Could those parents that have made an order kindly collect their books from the school reception area?

Other parents that have not yet ordered; the books are now available at RM35 each.

Happy reading!

Thank you,

Alan Savage
