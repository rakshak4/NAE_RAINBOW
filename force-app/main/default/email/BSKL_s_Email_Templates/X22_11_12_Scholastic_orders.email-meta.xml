Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

The Scholastic catalogue orders are now being taken and this is a reminder that tomorrow, Friday is the deadline for the orders.

However, for parents of the younger children from Foundation and Years 1 and 2, the deadline is Monday.



The reason for this is we did not receive enough catalogues, but now we have them.

The books take 3-4 weeks to arrive and the Scholastic rep informed me that if books are ordered any later, the children might not get them in time before we break up for Xmas.

So I am asking if you could adhere to this strict and necessary deadline.



Payment:

Cash is fine, but please attach to order form with a paper clip as money is easily lost.



Cheques to be made out to scholastic please and if using a credit card, please do not forget to put all your details.



I thank you all for your patience, the books will arrive in time as I have been told we are being given a priority order this time, given that the school breaks up sooner than we all think!



Thank you and enjoy your books with your children.
