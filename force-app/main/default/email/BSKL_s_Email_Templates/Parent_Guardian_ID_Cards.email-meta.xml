Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Thank you very much for submitting the relevant photographs for the school to start producing your ID cards.
For those that have not yet submitted them can you please do so asap.  You can submit them in soft or hard copy to the school whatever is easiest to you.  If you email them to the school please do so on info@britishschool.edu.my
As of next week we will start to produce the ID cards and pass them out to be worn.   By the 1st February there will be full implementation of the wearing of ID cards on the school campus.
We very much appreciate your support on this matter.
Have a lovely weekend!

Regards,

Administration Team
The British International School of Kuala Lumpur
