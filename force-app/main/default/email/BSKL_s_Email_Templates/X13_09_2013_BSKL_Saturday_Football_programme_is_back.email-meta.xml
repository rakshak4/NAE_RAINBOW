Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Please find attached the ASA Information Booklet for the first term.

This year the children based in the primary campus (Reception - Year 3) will register online as they did last year. Please follow the link below to register. Choose a first, second and third choice for each day. You will have to repeat the process for each child.

Year 4 - 6 will register themselves in class on Wednesday morning. Please discuss the options with your children and ensure that they are prepared to make their selections on Wednesday.

I will be available in my room (4SA) on Tuesday between 3:00 and 4:00pm to answer any questions you may have.
