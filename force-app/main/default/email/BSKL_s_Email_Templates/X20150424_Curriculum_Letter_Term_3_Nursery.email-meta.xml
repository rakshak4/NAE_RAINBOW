Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName}

Nursery Curriculum – Term Three



Welcome back! I hope you all had a relaxing and happy break. I’m looking forward to hearing all the holiday news, and embarking on our final term in Nursery.



Highlights of last term

Last term went in a flash, with all the busy activities we were engaged in. The children explored deepest space, and even made spells and potions in the witch’s den. We enjoyed watching the production of ‘The Snail and the Whale’ and cheered for our favourites in the BSKL Idol. Earlier in the term, we were treated to an amazing Chinese New Year assembly, and all the children looked fantastic in their traditional Chinese clothes.



What happens when?

Swimming and PE lessons remain on the same set days as in Term 2. On swimming days, please send the following named items in a bag: swimming costume, goggles, towel, swimming hat and pool shoes. On PE days your child can come to school dressed in their PE kit and their trainers.



It’s really important that you name all items of clothing, shoes, water bottles, hats and bags. Everything looks the same so it can be very confusing for the teachers as well as the children.  Please remember that sun hats should be in school at all times and your child should bring a fresh bottle of water with them every day.



Any changes to normal school routine or important dates or events (such as dress up days, concerts, trips etc.) will be shared with you via the school calendar and we encourage parents to access the Parent Portal regularly.



This term our topics are…

This final term will hold similar excitements as we have a range of topics to share with the children.  The first half of the term is going to start off with a look at some famous artists, including Kandinsky, Van Gogh, and Jackson Pollock. We will look at the difference in their creative styles and will try to recreate some of their famous paintings and make some of our own using their techniques.



‘Traditional Tales’ will be our next focus.  This will give the children the opportunity to share what tales they know and to perhaps learn some new ones.  The children will use this topic to sequence stories, and to come up with some alternate endings of their own. Finally, the children will delve into the wonders of ‘The circus’, learning all sorts of circus skills such as balancing, spinning plates, and having a fun dress up day to end on.



After half term, we will start by focusing on ‘Kings and Queens.’ An exciting topic looking into, not only stories about kings and queens but where they live, who lives in the castle, what they look like and much more. Role Play will play a huge part in this topic (so get ready to bow to your young ‘Highness’!) Finally, ‘Let’s get Active’ where the children will show off their physical skills and develop new ones. They will also look into Healthy Eating and a look at the body and how it works.



Within all these topics the children will have the opportunity for lots of creative artwork, language and literacy development and mathematical concepts. As the term rounds to a close there will be lots of support and activities to aid the smooth transition into Reception.



Each week the children’s learning is reviewed to assist with planning in greater detail for the following week. Our topic will expand according to the children’s interests and you can follow our weekly progress via the class blogs on the Parent Portal. Tasks will be fun and practical, using both the inside and outside learning environments. The teachers and other adults supporting your child will make sure that the activities are suited to your child’s unique needs.



Phonics

Your child will continue to take part in a daily phonics lesson following the Letters and Sounds Programme. Some children are learning the sounds in the Phase 2 section of this programme and will be exploring rhyme, alliteration and developing vocabulary to talk about sounds. Speaking, understanding and listening skills will also play a large part in our daily learning.



What about Mathematics?

The children will continue developing their confidence with number, shape, space and size through practical activities, number rhymes and stories. There will be lots of practical, fun activities to support their understanding of number. We are focusing on numbers up to twenty; both to recognise and to understand the value. Sorting and sequencing activities, as well as creating patterns will also play a part in the final term.



Modern Foreign Languages (MFL)

The Children have either Spanish or Mandarin four times a week learning new words to support our class topics and developing language skills through a range of fun games, songs and practical activities.



Music and PE

Taking place twice a week, the children will be learning new songs and have the opportunity to play lots of different instruments, as well as music and movement . This term we will also be focusing on learning all the songs for the EYFS production. In Swimming, the children use the pool to develop water confidence and swimming skills. Finally, PE is held on Tuesdays where they learn a wide range of sports skills including balancing, catching, climbing and much more.



Can parents help?

We always welcome donations of junk boxes, bottle tops, cardboard tubes, corks and other things that we can use in our model making areas.



Home-time

For safeguarding purposes, can we ask that adults wear their identification tags at all times within school and if your child is due to be collected by someone else, please do inform us in advance.



Illness

Please remember that if your child has had sickness or diarrhoea, then they are not to attend school for 48 after the last bout. If your child has a temperature, they should also stay at home until the temperature has gone and your child is feeling better.  If your child becomes ill or unwell at school, the school nurse will contact you and request that you come and collect them.
