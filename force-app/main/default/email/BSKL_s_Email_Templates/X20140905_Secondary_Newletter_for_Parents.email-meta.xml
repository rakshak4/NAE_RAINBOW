Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName}

Welcome back! I hope you have all enjoyed a very good holiday – clearly the pupils have, although it is encouraging to discover that many (most?!) were looking forward to returning to school. The Secondary School does have a very different look to it this year, in terms of facilities and staff, but our ethos remains focused on achieving the best for all our pupils. New classrooms have been added, including an ICT suite for Graphic Design and GCSE Computing. We welcome a number of new staff: Mrs Pauline Gradden (Senior Teacher and English), Mr Jason Reeves (Head of KS4, Pupil Development and Geography), Ms Jasmin Burton-Morgan (Head of Science), Mr David Kennedy (Science), Mr Nik Dhand (Maths), Ms Sarah Bajc (Economics, Business Studies and Teacher i/c Student Leadership), Ms Rosa Ali (Spanish), Ms Esther Wainwright (Drama, English) and Ms Kelly Newton (Graphic Design and ICT). We also welcome back Mr Mike Sallabank, Mr Lindemann Fernandes and Ms Kia Brame as Secondary Teaching Assistants. Mrs Cathy Taylor (former Year 5 TA) joins us as Examinations Officer. Many of you will already have had the opportunity to meet these staff on ‘Meet the Tutor’ afternoon. I would like to wish them, and of course your children, good luck for this year.

Our new coffee bar cannot have escaped your notice! Parents are of course encouraged to make full use of this, at any time of the day, but please do not go upstairs to try and meet with teachers without an appointment, unless there is an emergency – all teachers and tutors will of course be happy to meet with you at a time convenient to both. It can also be unsettling for children, and detrimental to their independence, if parents are waiting around classrooms whilst lessons are happening; thank you for your support.

Our first (albeit small) IGCSE cohort received excellent news over the summer: 13 of our Year 9 pupils sat 16 GCSE papers in Mandarin, Bahasa and French, achieving 15 A* grades and 1 A grade. No matter the level of difficulty of any exam, it is a difficult thing for a 14 year old pupil to prepare for an exam intended for 16 year olds. Congratulations to those pupils, and to the MFL Department.
As you know, we use a setting system in our core subjects: in Year 7 only Maths is set, in Year 8 Maths and English and in Year 9 all three core subjects are set. It is important to realise that we do have able cohorts at BSKL, and even if a pupil is in set 3 for, say Science, this does not mean they cannot access Separate Sciences at GCSE, or attempt Science A-Levels. We always put a pupil in the group where they are most likely to fulfil their potential. We use a range of measures including SATs results, internal exam results, school reports and teacher judgement/experience. Over the next two weeks your children will be sitting benchmark tests (I will write about these in more detail next week) to give us some additional information on how they best learn. These are tests of innate ability and pupils cannot prepare for them (and should not worry about them). Setting for these first few weeks is therefore provisional and there may be some movement between sets when we have looked at all available data.

Last year we spent an inordinate amount of time managing pupil lockers: keys (including spares) were frequently lost, and replacement was a time consuming process. This meant a good deal of inconvenience for pupils and staff, so I have asked our maintenance department to attach hasps to all lockers. We will eventually be asking all pupils to bring in their own padlocks, and they will be responsible for holding any keys (please get numerous spares cut). Combination locks (as long as the code is not shared) are fine. Pupils should know by now which of them needs a padlock for next week, so please can you purchase one over the weekend. Please ensure the locking ring is no more than 6mm diameter.

A number of parents have been asking about Activities Week: this will run from Monday 29th June 2015, with the Europe Trip departing the previous Thursday or Friday. We will be running a range of cost/experience trips each of which will be open to all year groups. These trips, whilst hugely beneficial, can be expensive, and I hope that if you know in advance this pattern is to continue, it will help your planning for future years – it may be easier to convince a child to take part in the school-based activities one year with a view to saving towards a longer-haul destination the following year, for example. Options for next June will be:

1. School-based cross-curricular activities and day trips. Approximate cost RM500.
2. Environmentally-based/adventure trip to Tioman or similar (within Malaysia). Approximate cost RM2800.
3. Outdoor/camping/adventure /team building trip to Chiang Mai, Thailand. Approximate cost RM3000.
4. History/Cultural/Language trip to Europe. Approximate cost RM10000.

I hope this will help you to make decisions. I know that Mrs Parker needs a firm commitment soon from pupils intending to go on the Europe trip. There will be more details to follow, but you will appreciate that much depends on flight costs and individual providers: Year Heads will be working on this over the next few weeks.

My final duty of this letter is to invite the parents of new pupils to our Key Stage 3 Curriculum Evening on Thursday 18th September, 5.30pm – 7.30pm. This is intended to give you an overview of the Key Stage 3 curriculum and some detail on the processes and systems we use at BSKL. There will be an opportunity to meet and hear from teaching staff, but this is not a parents’ evening and there will not be time to discuss individual pupils in detail. I do hope many of you will be able to attend.

I hope you have a very good weekend.


Kind regards

Derek Mackey
