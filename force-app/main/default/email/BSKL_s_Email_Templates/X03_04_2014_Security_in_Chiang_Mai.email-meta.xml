Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Over the last few days we have contacted the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the British Embassy in Bangkok, a number of reputable international schools in Asia, AIG Insurance, and taken advice from OFFSEAS (Overseas Forum for South East Asian Schools) - effectively the lead body for educational trips in this part of Asia.

The resounding message we have received is, it is safe for the proposed Year 9 trip to go ahead.

The following information has been posted on the website of the FCO:

During the evening of 21 March there were bomb attacks at three locations in Chiang Mai: a PTT Petrol station in tambon Nong Hoi Muang district; Boonrawd Brewery in tambon Yang Nerng of Sarapee district; and the Andamon Seafood restaurant in tambon Pa Dad, Muang Chiang Mai district. The attacks injured 4 people and caused damage to property.

The advice from the FCO is that it remains safe to travel to most parts of Thailand, including Chiang Mai. These events took place some distance from the city centre and our pupils will be located rurally, well away from the city - none of these areas are close to where the pupils will be. I hope you also will find the following information helpful:

Harrow International School have approx 1250 students taking part in residential trips over the coming months in the Chiang Mai region. Their Health and Safety Manager is confident in continuing to send groups there.
Bromsgrove International have sent 4 trips over the last month to Chiang Mai and will be sending more.
Traill School have said that there is no issue and they are happy to keep sending their groups there.
Phuket International Academy attended the EARCOS (East Asia Regional Council for Schools) conference last weekend and the political/safety situation in Thailand was discussed. They had no concerns with students going to Chiang Mai.
NIST (New International School Thailand) have said it is very safe and they will continue to send their groups to Chiang Mai. The coordinator there is a professional outdoor instructor and helps to run the OFFSEAS group.
UWC (singapore) undertake nearly 500 overseas trips per year. They subscribe to ISOS, a world-leading security and medical risk analysis company: they will be sending their groups.
I do understand the concern that these headlines have prompted. However, I am absolutely confident that there is no significant increased risk to our pupils - indeed (and I do not say this flippantly), I would he happy to still send my own children on this trip.

I do hope you will be reassured by the advice given by so many individuals and organisations who are expert in this field. We will of course continue to monitor the situation and advise you should there be any new information.

Kind regards
