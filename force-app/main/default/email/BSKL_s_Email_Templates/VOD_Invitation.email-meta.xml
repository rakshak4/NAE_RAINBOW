Dear {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},
We are holding a Primary School Virtual Open Event on 23 July from 2-3pm so you can see our school&apos;s outstanding facilities, immerse yourself within our curriculum, meet our Head of Primary and find out what makes our students so happy - all from the comfort of your own home.

Spaces are limited so register your place today to not miss out.
