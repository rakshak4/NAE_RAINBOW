Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Most of you will have the Scholastic book club brochure for your children to order books.

Could you please ignore this catalogue as we are getting new ones sent in Malaysian RM currency, instead of British pounds/American dollars.

The new brochures should arrive within the next 10 days and will be distributed accordingly.

Sorry for any inconvenience. It will be worth the wait, as the newly ordered brochures have books that are specifically aimed at very young children as well as older ones.

Thank you,

Alan Savage
Literacy Co-ordinator, Head of Year 8.

Kind Regards,


Administration Team
The British International School of Kuala Lumpur
