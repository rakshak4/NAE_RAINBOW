    <textOnly>Good evening,


Unfortunately, our BSKL Sixth Form Virtual Open Day has been postponed.


Thank you for your interest in attending. We were very much looking forward to the opportunity to introduce you to our teaching staff and even a few of our Sixth Form students. While we have not yet set a date for rescheduling the event, we will update you as soon as possible with that information.


We know that you likely have questions about Sixth Form at BSKL; whether itâ€™s about admissions or the A-Level Program. Please do not hesitate to reach out to us if you would like to schedule a Virtual Discovery Meeting or speak to a member of our Sixth Form Academic Team about the program. This can be scheduled through our admissions office by replying to this email.


Thank you for your understanding.



Sincerely,



Carl, April and Nadia
