Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Please click on the link below for a useful document about starting school. For the first week of term, pre-nursery children will be starting on half day sessions only, to help with the settling in process. That means the day will finish at 11:30. Obviously every child is different, and depending on their needs we will look at each child individually to determine when they are ready to manage a full day of school, and all that it entails.

I hope you all have a wonderful summer, and I look forward to seeing you all in September. Please note that there is a meet the teacher day prior to that on August 28th.
