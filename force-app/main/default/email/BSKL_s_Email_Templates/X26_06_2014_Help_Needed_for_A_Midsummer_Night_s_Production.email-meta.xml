Dear Parents,

Please could you help out with the remaining props needed for Thursday&apos;s production of A Midsummer Night&apos;s Dream. If you have any of these items, please email me at janine.murphy@britishschool.edu.my and deliver to Secondary Reception asap. Also, if anyone has a smoke machine we could borrow, I&apos;d be very grateful.

Many thanks,
Janine Murphy
