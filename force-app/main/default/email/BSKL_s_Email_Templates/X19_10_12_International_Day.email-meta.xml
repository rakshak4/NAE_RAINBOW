We are producing a BSKL passport for the day and children will have their passport stamped when visiting each country.

Lunch for the day has been organised to include food from UK, Thailand, Italy, India, Malaysia, France, and Japan. So there will also be an international flavour to our lunches.


Finally, all children are most welcome to come into school in national costume and if they do not have a national costume they may adopt a country to wear the costume of that country.


It promises to be a fantastic occasion!


We look forward to seeing you all there.

Kind Regards,


Administration Team
