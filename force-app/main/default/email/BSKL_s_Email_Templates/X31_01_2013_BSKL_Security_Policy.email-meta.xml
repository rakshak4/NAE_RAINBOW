Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

As of February 1st the following changes will take place to the schools security policy.

SECURITY POLICY - ENTRY TO SCHOOL PREMISES
Anyone entering the school premises will require one of the following:
1. Valid School Issue Entry Card
2. Valid School Issue Car Sticker
3. Valid Photo ID (driver’s license, passport or similar)
If entering with a Photo ID, the ID must be surrendered to security. It may be collected when leaving the premises.

The School Issue Entry Card has been placed into your children’s school bags for your collection. Please contact  us if you do not find it.

The schools security policy will be strictly enforced. We very much appreciate your support and cooperation.

Regards,
Administration Team
The British International School of Kuala Lumpur
