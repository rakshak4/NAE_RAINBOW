Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},





The Events and Fundraising Committee (EFC) are holding their annual elections Wednesday 10th October in the BSKL Cafeteria at 2pm. The EFC would like to invite all interested BSKL parents to attend and take part in the elections. We are looking for new faces to take on some important roles within the EFC; for example the Events Coordinator and the Class Rep Coordinator. Please come along and take part, even if you aren&apos;t interested in a committee role - we are always looking for fresh ideas!


We look forward to seeing you there!


Kind Regards
The Events and Fundraising Committee


Kind Regards,


Administration Team
