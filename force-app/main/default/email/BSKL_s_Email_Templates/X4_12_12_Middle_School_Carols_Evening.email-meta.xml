Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

We hope you are all excited about the upcoming Christmas Middle School Carols evening and Bazaar on Monday 10th December. The spirit of Christmas has certainly arrived at BSKL!

The evening promises to be wonderful. The carols will start at 6pm promptly in the school gymnasium and furthermore there will be the Christmas Bazaar from 4.30 â€“ 8pm in the school cafeteria.

Please note it is compulsory for ALL Middle School students to attend, since the are all taking part in the performance, together with the orchestra. They are required to be in full school uniform, including their blazers. The children will need to be back in school by 5.30pm (orchestra at 5.15pm).

We hope to see you all there for a fun filled evening of fabulous Christmas carols and the annual festive bazaar!
