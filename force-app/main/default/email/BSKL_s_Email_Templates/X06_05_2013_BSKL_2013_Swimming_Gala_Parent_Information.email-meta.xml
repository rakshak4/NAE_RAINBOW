Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

Dear Parents,

The BSKL Swimming Galas 2013 will take place next Thursday 9th May for Year 1-4 students and Friday 10th for Year 5-8 students at The Club. Parents are most welcome to attend.

All Year 1 to 8 students will be participating in swim events held on the above days. Please inform me and respective class teachers if your child will not be participating.
You are welcome to come to support your children, the viewing area is the balcony area on the first floor (same level as squash and tennis courts by the club). It is essential that the poolside area is clear as there will be a lot of students and races to get through. We appreciate your co-operation on this matter.

We will be dividing students into 2 groups/sessions which will participate on different days:

Thursday 9th May
Group 1 : Year 1-4, 8:00am-11:30am
Parents and school vans to drop children off at the club in the morning at 7.45am NOT school.
Students to leave The Club and go back to School via school buses at 11:30am at the latest.
They will need to be in their swimming attire and bring their drinks/snacks which they would normally have at break time.
Lunch will be back in School and normal lessons to resume after (ASAs on Thursday as normal)
