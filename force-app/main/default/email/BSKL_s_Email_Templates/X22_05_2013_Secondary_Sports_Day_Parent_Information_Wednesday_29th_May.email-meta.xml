Dear {!Contact.Salutation} {!Contact.FirstName} {!Contact.LastName},

The BSKL Middle School Sports Day 2013 will take place next Wednesday 29th May at Kelana Jaya Stadium MBPJ, Jalan SS 7/15, Petaling Jaya, Selangor.

You are most welcome to attend. We would very much appreciate parent co-operation with regards to allowing the students to be under the care of the school staff during Sports day. As such, the Track, Field and Canopy areas are out of bounds to parents but there is plenty of space to sit and watch from the stands.

A gentle reminder, students are not to return home with parents after sports day. All students must take the bus with Teachers back to school after events are finished.

All Year 6 to 8 students will be participating in Sport events held on this day. Please inform respective class teachers if your child will not be participating.

Please note, if your child normally takes the school bus but on this day you will be bringing them to the Kelana Jaya Stadium please inform the school no later than Friday 24th May.
