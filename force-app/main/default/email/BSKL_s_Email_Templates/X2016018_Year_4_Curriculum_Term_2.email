They will also participate in regular guided reading sessions.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><b>Mathematics</b></font></div><div><font size="4">In their maths lessons, the children will continue to use the new Mathematics Mastery approach to ensure that they achieve a deep understanding of the concepts they are learning. This term, they will initially continue their learning of Area and Perimeter before moving on to Time, Fractions, Graphs and Decimals. Problem Solving will be embedded into all areas of maths curriculum. To improve their mathematical fluency, the children will also be aiming to improve their knowledge of time tables and corresponding division facts through various challenges.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><b>Science</b></font></div><div><font size="4">Our science topics this term are Living Things and their Habitats and Animals, including humans. Within the unit Living Things and their Habitats, children will explore and use classification keys to group, identify and name a variety of living things in their local and wider environment. They will also learn about how environments can change and the effect of these changes. During the Animals, including humans unit, children will learn about simple functions of the basic parts of the digestive system in humans as well as identify different types of teeth in humans and their functions. They will also learn how to construct and interpret food chains. Investigations, as well as the acquisition of knowledge, will be a key part in the learning process.&nbsp;</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><b>Computing</b></font></div><div><font size="4">In Term 1, all children in Year 4 received their own iPad mini.

They will also investigate river settlements, coastlines and flooding.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><b>Modern Foreign Languages (MFL)</b></font></div><div><font size="4">In the Mandarin lessons for beginners, they will be covering the topics of “Chinese Zodiac”, “Birthday” and “Days of week and Month”.

The children will engage in activities that will develop their ability to identify different intervals, starting at different points on a diatonic and pentatonic scale. They will transfer these skills into melody, identifying the intervals between notes in a song. They will also compose ostinatos using various intervals with scales to accompany different pieces of music.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><b>The Class Orchestra</b></font></div><div><font size="4">This topic will explore musical arrangements. Through a variety of songs the children will identify key phrases by ear, determining changes in pitch.

On Friday, children will have a spelling homework where they will investigate spelling patterns. These will be assessed the following Friday where the words will be used in context. The children will also need to continue practising times tables and corresponding division facts. In addition, children will receive a weekly homework activity from their Mandarin or Spanish teacher.</font></div><div><font size="4"><br></font></div><div><font size="4"><b>Communication</b></font></div><div><font size="4">Each Year 4 class will continue to share with you what is happening in class via the class portal blogs.
