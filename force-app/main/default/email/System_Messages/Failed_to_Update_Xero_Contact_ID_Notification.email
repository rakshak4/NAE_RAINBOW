This is most likely caused because the invoicing contact of the SF account has exactly the same name as an existing, active Xero contact and contact names in Xero must be unique for active contacts (Thankfully Xero are planning to change this logic in the near future!).</font></span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: right; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br></font></span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: right; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">The full error message is as follows:&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: right;">{!Account.Error_Message__c}</span></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: right; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br></font></span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left;"><span style="text-align: right; background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Please take the following action immediately to rectify this problem:</font></span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left;"><ol><li><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Open the two accounts in SF (identified via link and error message above).</font></li><li><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If both accounts are in fact the same physical person (check phone number, email etc.) and also the same family unit (same other parent) then: <br>i) Merge the two accounts in Salesforce. In most cases the account that originally has the Xero Contact ID will be the one you keep, although it doesn't have to be. Remember that the Xero Contact ID can only be present on one of the two accounts.<br>ii) If you decided to keep the SF account that initially had the Xero Contact ID then you need to update the 'Xero Contact Code' on the contact record in Xero as this will have been updated to that of the newly and wrongly created SF account. To do this, create a dummy invoice against the account and click 'Send to Xero'. Once done, the contact in Xero should be correctly updated with the correct 'Xero Contact Code' (the ID of the SF account). Check this. If all good, delete the dummy invoice in both Xero and SF and you're done.<br>iii) If you decided to keep the SF account that initially did not have the Xero Contact ID then no further action is necessary as the contact in Xero will already reflect the correct data.&nbsp;<br></font></li><li><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If the account without the Xero Contact ID (first link) is not a duplicate (e.g. when it's a completely different parent who just happens to have the same name or when a parent needs two accounts because of two different family units, such as a different 'other parent') then:<br>i) Rename the parent under one or both of the accounts so that the names are unique. If the parent is responsible for one child under one account and another under another account then their name can be appended with (c/o [child name]) to identify them uniquely.<br>ii) You now need to restore the 'Xero Contact Code' in Xero for the relevant contact (at this stage there is only one). Create a dummy invoice against the account stipulated in the error message above and send it to Xero to do this. Check the correct account ID appears on the Xero contact and then delete the dummy invoice in Xero and SF.<br>iii) Finally, you need to create a new Xero contact for the new SF account and link the invoice that was created in the first place to the new contact. Create a dummy invoice against this account and send to Xero to create the new Xero contact. Check that it's created correctly and then delete the dummy invoice in both Xero and SF.<br>iv) After deleting the invoice in SF you should still be on the account which caused the original error. Find the invoice that was sent in the first instance and click the link to view it in Xero. On the Xero invoice, change the contact to the one you just created. Hopefully there will be no payments against this invoice which will make things straightforward. Otherwise the payments will need to be removed, the invoice linked to the correct contact and then the payments re-applied.</font></li></ol><div><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Remember to communicate any changes to the relevant people in school, as required.</font></div></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><br></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: left; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This is an automated message.</font></div></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial; text-align: left;"><br></div></div></span></div>]]></td>
