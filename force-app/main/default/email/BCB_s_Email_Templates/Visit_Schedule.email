<p class="p1">Warm greeting from The British College of Brazil. We are delighted that you are interested in joining our school and we look forward to getting to know you soon.</p>
<p class="p1"><br>
</p>
<p class="p1">Our goal for our student's Education is to help them love learning and achieve more than they may have thought possible. For us, this means tailoring their education to them personally and connecting them to our Global Community part of the&nbsp;Nord&nbsp;AngliaEducation&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nordangliaeducation.com/%22%20%5Ct%20%22_blank"><span class="s1">www.nordangliaeducation.com</span></a>&nbsp;family of schools.</p>

<p class="p1">I am sure you've already read a lot about our school on our website&nbsp;and so I'd just like to highlight 3 things which will make your children&nbsp;Education at BCB truly&nbsp;exceptional:</p>
<p class="p1"><br>
</p>
<p class="p1">·&nbsp;Our students follow the respected&nbsp;English National Curriculum&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/co"><span class="s1">https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-curriculum</span></a>.</p>
<p class="p1">·&nbsp;We are known for our warm and inclusive community with over 38 nationalities in our student body.</p>
<p class="p1">·&nbsp;We educate the whole child - we want your children to achieve outstanding academic results but also to become confident, principled and open-minded young people who are ambitious for their future and who will make a difference in the world.</p>
<p class="p1">·&nbsp;Most of our teachers are UK native (98%) of them, and every class has a teacher and a teacher assistant.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Although our academic year runs from August to June, we accept students throughout the year, depending on availability. Accordingly to their date of birth, Lautaro would start Year 1 and Elena, Nursery of this academic year. We have a vacancy for both year groups at the moment.</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>

In the meantime, don’t hesitate to contact me if you have any further questions – I’m here to help! I will be also happy to schedule a Skype call with you, myself and my head of primary Mrs. Alison Priestley, who will be able to answer any academic questions you may have.</p>
<p class="p1">&nbsp;</p>
