Teachers do not have to be in their rooms until 7.30am so we have no way of monitoring who is in the building. Clearly this is an unacceptable risk. Any children dropped off before 7.30 am can wait in front of the school until the doors are opened.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Afternoon Pick up time&nbsp;</b></div><div>We have seen increasing numbers of EYFS and primary aged children playing unsupervised in the Grand Hall, on the football pitch or elsewhere around the school after 3 pm. Again, this is not something that can be allowed to happen in case of accidents or emergencies. So, if your child is not in an ASC, they must be collected by 3pm and kept with you or a responsible adult nominated by you. Any children not collected by 3 .10 ( 4.10 after ASCs) will be asked to wait in the meeting room next to the Principal's office so that we can ensure that we know where they are and can keep them safe.&nbsp;</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Identity checks and front door access&nbsp;</b></div><div>We will be trialling a system of designated In / Out doors at the front of the school to help ensure we can keep a closer track on who is entering and leaving school. These two main doors will be manned by security guards who will be checking carefully your identity cards. Whilst this may slow things down a little for you, please do understand that this is being done as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure that children are kept safe at school.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Kind regards&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>BSY Admin&nbsp;<br></div></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div></font></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="2" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="">The British School Yangon</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
