On Monday we had our formal opening of the new school canteen. I have received many, many positive comments from students, staff and parents about the new canteen and the improvement in the food offer. This is great news; long may it continue. There is still more work to be done and we will continue to consult with parents, staff and students on further improvements that can be made over the coming weeks and months. It is certainly a great start.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">On Tuesday we opened the primary playground equipment. Again, we have received some great reviews and it is good to see so many children enjoying the new facilities on offer. I know they have been very patient with us, waiting for the opening and I am very pleased that we are now fully operational.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I would like to extend a big thank you to you as parents for your enormous patience whilst we continued to work on these two projects.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">The final part of the campus development project is the football pitch and covered roofing for the pitch and the swimming pool. The original plan was to carry out all the work over the three week holiday. Having met with the team on many occasions, it has become evident that it is unlikely that they would be able to achieve this in just three weeks. After careful consideration, we have agreed that they can start the work on this area from Monday 3rd December. This will give them an extra two weeks and a better chance of success that we will be able to open and use the facility from the start of term two in January. The concrete rear part of the school will therefore be closed off with guards present from Monday and a fence will be erected around the area to prevent access from the school or swimming pool sides. The workers will use the rear gate of the school site only and will not have access to the main school building without permission. Work will begin from Monday on preparing and building the initial support structure for the roof. We will of course be closely monitoring the situation daily to ensure there is little interference with the operations of the school. In addition, we have revised our evacuation procedures and have walked through our new evacuation plan with staff and students today just in case of an emergency over the final two weeks of term. Thank you again for your support and understanding whilst we complete the final phase of the build.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I mentioned last week about the launch of our Global Goals initiative here at BSY.
