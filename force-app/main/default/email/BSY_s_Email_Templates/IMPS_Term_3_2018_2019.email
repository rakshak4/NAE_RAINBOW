<p class="MsoNormal">Please read this email for details about the Individual
Music Programme and how to apply for your child(ren) to apply for a second
study, or to sign up for the first time. The registration link can be found at
the end of this email. If your child(ren) is/are continuing lessons from last
term, and you have already re-registered them, you can disregard this email.
Otherwise, please continue reading for further information.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Children in Reception are offered the chance to learn piano
or violin. Children in Years 1– 3 will be able to choose from ukulele, violin,
cello, drum, and piano lessons. Whilst we do offer classical guitar to this age
group, it is recommended that children begin on the ukulele, as size and
complexity of the instrument can often be a difficult barrier to learning
guitar at this age. Additionally, lessons in<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">viola and guitar are available for children in Year 3, and
from Year 4 children also have the option of learning the French horn or
trumpet. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">These individual sessions will take place during the school
day, and will require students to be withdrawn from curriculum lessons for 25
minutes<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">(Primary children), or 30 minutes (Secondary children). The
IMP timetable will rotate to ensure that your child is not missing the same classes
each week.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Should your child be accepted onto the programme, they will
need to have their own instrument on which to practise at home, as personal
practice is integral to progress and subsequently enjoyment. Students should
bring their instrument to school on days when they have lessons (apart from
piano or drum students – require sticks only), and these should be clearly
labelled to avoid loss or accidental swapping of instruments (both the
instrument itself - including bows - and the case). The school has a limited
stock of violins, violas, trumpets, French horns and guitars, which can
potentially be loaned during the first few weeks for the duration of the lesson
<b>only</b>, and provided the instruments
are not required at that time for PIP lessons. We are happy to advise about
where to purchase instruments. If you look at the Terms and Conditions, which
are accessible from the Google Form, you will see details of a<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">music shop which offers discount to parents of BSY children
on presentation of your ID badge.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">The fee for Term 3, which will be a course of 5 lessons
starting on April 23rd, is $75 (USD), and is paid in full, directly to the
school Finance Office. You will receive an invoice for this once your child is
enrolled. However, your child’s place is not guaranteed until full payment has
been received. This fee is to be paid directly to the finance department, and
you will receive an invoice soon after registration closes.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If you would like your child to participate in the
programme, please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjI6Lx7YugmWIKCIP8zPspXbn0G6LcB76nndid9B2ez1eh2Q/viewform">this</a>
Google Form by Monday 25th March. Please be reminded that the number of places
is limited and therefore successful applications are subject to availability.
For this reason, priority is given firstly to students who are continuing on
the programme, those who have already been on waiting lists, and those who have
shown a commitment to musical endeavours in the past.<o:p></o:p></p>
