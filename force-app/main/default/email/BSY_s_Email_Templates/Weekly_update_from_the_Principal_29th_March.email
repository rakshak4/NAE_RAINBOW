It was a wonderful evening and great to see so many students from across the schools performing together. I know you will also join me in thanking all our Music staff who supported the students throughout the build up to and on the evening.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">A huge thank you to everyone who came and supported the Family Fun Day last Saturday. I have received a great deal of positive comments and thanks for the event. This was the first time we have attempted to host such a large event and we were extremely pleased with the event and are already thinking about how to make it even better next year. Clearly these types of events do not happen by accident. There were many staff involved in planning and executing such a great day. On behalf of the school community I would like to thank them all for their hard work and efforts in ensuring such a special day for all.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">On Monday our International Award (Duke of Edinburgh) students returned from their practice expedition safely. They completed a long hike, a short hike and one night camping. The trip was challenging but fun and has been great preparation for their real expedition later in the year.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">We concluded this week with the Primary and Secondary swimming galas. There was a great atmosphere at pool side with many families and staff supporting the children in their efforts. Well done to everyone for making a swimming gala so enjoyable and fun.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Next week we will be hosting the Year 4 production ‘Mystery at Mingalar Mansion’.

They have taken all the feedback from staff, students and parents and are drawing together some conclusions and some recommendations for further consideration. After the holiday the work they have produced will be shared with all families for further input before we move towards finalising this piece of work through term 3. I will update you further on this straight after the holiday.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">As advance notice, please be advised that the first week back beginning 23rd we will be celebrating world book week. On Friday April 26th we will be encouraging a whole school dress as a book character for one day. We hope that many children and staff will take part in this.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Please also be reminded that the school closes for holiday next Friday 5th.
