I have been hearing many stories of some great travels and exciting adventures over the break. It is really good to see everyone back in school.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">A great deal has happened since I last wrote to you, so I am going to attempt to summarise all the main points into this one letter. Apologies for the length but it is important that you get these updates and better than receiving multiple emails form the school which would be hard to keep track of.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Over the half term work continued at a pace on the site. The following works were completed:</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">1. &nbsp; &nbsp; Exit road from school resurfaced</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">2. &nbsp; &nbsp; Lighting rig in the Theatre installed</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">3. &nbsp; &nbsp; Line markings and safe crossing areas marked at the front of the school</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">On Monday we had our soft opening of the parent café and you will have received an update on the availability and access for students. We wish to ensure that any access by students to the café is carefully managed and controlled. We will keep this under review for the next few weeks. What is becoming clear is that students and parents of Year 7 to Year 9 wish to have more access to the café particularly after school when they have bus journeys or have been involved in ASCs or fixtures. We will consider this carefully in the coming days. Please keep your feedback coming on this as this will help guide me in the decisions we make on this issue.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I am very pleased to say that we are still on schedule for the swimming pool and canteen opening as I outlined before the break. The swimming pool was formally handed over to the school on Thursday and we are planning to start the swimming programme next week. The main canteen building has been completed. It will now take two weeks to install all the kitchen equipment, carry out deep cleaning and complete Health and Safety checks ready for opening. I will of course keep you updated weekly on this.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I am very sorry to say that I have delayed the opening of the primary playground equipment. The safety of your children is my number one concern and I take this very seriously. We have been waiting for the safety certificate from the supplier for a number of weeks and were due to receive it this week. I have not yet received this safety certificate. I am not prepared to open the equipment without this assurance that everything has been installed to the required safety standard that we all expect. We had made preparations with children and staff in anticipation of this approval. I appreciate that children will be disappointed by this decision but please be assured that their safety is my absolute priority, as tempting as it is to open it, I know you will understand my firm line and insistence on the absolute minimum requirements being met. Thank you for your continued patience and understanding on this. I will keep you update on this. In the meantime I have authorised Mr Harvey to invest in more play equipment and activities for the children.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">As you know, we have been working hard on developing a comprehensive sports programme and make full use of our wonderful facilities. I know you will join me in thanking Mr Dean and the PE staff for working very hard to make this happen at the start of the year. Please find attached the first half termly sport report from the team for your perusal.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Z16O81lJ0mT2XR1CGxBQSqhvA3uFBF_j" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Sport Report</a><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I have had the immense pleasure of watching our students compete in a full range of sports this term and I have been extremely proud of what they have achieved so far. Well done to everyone involved. It is always nice to see families supporting the competitions at the end of the day and I hope many of you will take the opportunity to come in and watch your children in their various sports. You will always be more than welcome. I had the pleasure of watching the volleyball and basketball competitions this week and our students were exceptional. In many cases they were competing against children much older than themselves. Well done to all of our sports stars.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">On Thursday a large and enthusiastic audience were thrilled by a very diverse range of performances at our Secondary's Got Talent event. The event was also an opportunity to try out our brand new state of the art lighting system, featured songs, dance, gymnastics and comedy and was a great success. It was hosted brilliantly by two of our Prefects and was very well supported by the school community. Well done to all involved! A big thank you also to Mr Coates and all the staff involved in this successful event.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Next Wednesday is a public holiday and the school is closed for normal operations. However, from 9.00 to 12.00 the school is running an international morning. You will have received details from Mr Harvey who is coordinating the event. You can come in at any time during those times and we hope many of you will come along to support the event. Please note that children must be accompanied by an adult at all times. The doors will open at 9.00 and close at 12.00. As it is a holiday there will be no buses. The school is in normal operation on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Due to the public holiday and the event, next Wednesday there will be no after school clubs running.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Over the next couple of months we will be starting our plans for expanding our after school provision and preparing for the Term 2 programme. If there are any parents who wish to support a particular club or want to be considered for running a club, then please can you contact Clara Tilemann at clara.tilemann@britishschoolyangon.org for an initial meeting to discuss potential involvement.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Finally, I have already met a small number of parents who put their names forward following my meeting to be part of a parent group. We have started to discuss what this group might look like, its function and the scope of the work. We are going to conclude this early next week and I will update all parents on the direction of this next week in my letter. What has become clear is there are a large number of parents who would like to be involved in focus groups to discuss key areas of the school. Each term I would like to focus on a couple of important areas of development for the school. Our teachers and students have started to consider the mission and values of the school. I would like to invite any parents who wish to contribute to this discussion to form a focus group to start exploring this important issue for the school. If you are interested in contributing to this piece of work, I am going to hold an initial meeting on Monday 29th October at 8.00am. You do not need to sign up, please just come along and attend the session to hear more about this topic and what is required. The meeting will last approximately one hour. For those families who are unable to attend I shall also be seeking your views over the coming weeks through other mechanisms as I want all members of the school community to have a part and say in this important piece of work.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I wish you all a very relaxing weekend.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;">Kind Regards&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;">Paul Holyome&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;">Principal&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div></font></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="2" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="">The British School Yangon</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
