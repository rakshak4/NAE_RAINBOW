It will be a perfect way for me to finish the week.<br><br>The ASCs for Term 2 have now finished. A very big thank you to all the staff, outside providers and parents who either ran a club or assisted running a club. It would not be possible to organise such a variety of clubs without the willingness and help from all our staff. This term, we offered over 65 ASCs which ran weekly. 93% of BSY students participated in at least 1 ASC per week and over 70 staff were involved with a club. Thank you again and we are looking forward to offering a new timetable for ASCs for Term 3 soon.<br><br>Many parents have been asking me about the work of the school with regard to the environment. We have been delighted with the work of the eco-committee in school who have been working tirelessly on this subject for the benefit of us all at school. Please see a piece written by Mr Ben Hough below:<br><br>I would like to outline some of the activities taking place at BSY which demonstrate our commitment to sustainability, expertly led by Ada Spiess in Year 10 and our student eco-committee. I was aware that students were already active in this area before I arrived at BSY last August, but I have to admit I’ve been particularly impressed by the contribution they have made to this area within a relatively limited framework. The eco-committee comprises students from the upper primary and secondary school as well as teachers including Ms Morse, Ms Finley and Ms Hassett. Already this year they have joined the eco-schools programme (see here for more details;<i style="color: blue; text-decoration-line: underline;"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://www.ecoschools.global/list-of-international-schools</span></i></span></span><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black;">),&nbsp;</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"><span class="gmail-MsoHyperlink">created an eco-action plan and started to make small but noticeable changes to the way the school runs. This has included, among (many) other things, a drive towards decreasing our energy consumption, a reduction in meat intake through meat-free Mondays in the canteen, the creation of a biodiversity garden (for which we have to thank Alessandra Giuliani and the excellent work of the Biodiversity club) and an objective to reduce, reuse and recycle as much of our waste as possible. On that note, I’m delighted to say that the BSY eco-committee has this week established a partnership with the recycling company Recyglo (see more here;<i style="color: blue; text-decoration-line: underline;"><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://www.recyglo.com/</span></i></span></span><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black;">),</span></i><span lang="EN-GB">who will collect and recycle our dry recyclable materials including paper, plastics and cans. If, like me, you have been collecting these materials at home, you can now ask your children to bring them into BSY and deposit them in our recycling bins, currently located in the grand hall area on the ground floor. Recyglo will also be attending our Family Fun day this weekend, so please take a minute to speak to them about the great work they are doing in Myanmar. If that wasn’t enough, the eco-committee are also planning an event to mark the annual Earth Hour (see more here:<span class="gmail-MsoHyperlink" style="color: blue; text-decoration-line: underline;"><i><span style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">https://www.earthhour.org/</span></i></span></span><i><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black;">)&nbsp;</span></i>and I would encourage everyone in our community to join them in celebrating this meaningful global event.<br><br>A huge thank you from me to the staff, parents and students who have worked so hard on this initiative.<br><br>On Saturday a group of secondary students will embark on their very first preparatory expedition for the International Award. (What is called the Duke of Edinburgh Award in the UK) This is the first ever expedition for BSY. I wish the students well and look forward to hearing their camping stories on their return early next week.<br><br>I look forward to seeing many of you at the event tomorrow and wish everyone a very relaxing weekend.</font><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Regards</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><font color="#222222">Paul Holyome&nbsp;</font></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><font color="#222222" style="">Principal&nbsp;</font></div><div style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 0px;"><br></div></font></span></div><div style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="2" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="">The British School Yangon</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
