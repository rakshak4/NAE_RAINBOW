What a wonderful performance form some of our youngest students. It was great fun, hugely engaging and very well performed. Thank you to all the families that also came to support the event and a big thank you to Mr Sherwin for writing and directing the performance. Well done everyone.<br><br>I am delighted to say that the EYFS outside play area is now complete and is open to the children. It was great to see the staff and children out there enjoying themselves this week. Now that the outside area is open, the EYFS area can now be securely locked down for the security of our very smallest and youngest children. This was always the intention, but not possible until the outside area was complete. Therefore, you will have received notice and seen signs explaining the new routes to be used to access the upper floors of the building. The safety and security of children is our number one priority and I know you will understand and support the new arrangements. Thank you.<br><br>We continue to monitor air quality around the school building both inside and out. Please be assured that we have and will continue to take the necessary action when we feel it appropriate. We continue to review our practice and procedures for this on a weekly basis.<br><br>This morning, we held an 'Under 8s Day'. Our Early Years Foundation Stage hosted children and staff from Primary for a celebration of childhood. There was a wide range of activities on offer, including free flow play indoors and outdoors, group art projects, sandwich and smoothie making, singing, dancing and face painting! Many thanks to our Head of Reception, Miss Mia Owens, who organised today's event, as well as to the whole EYFS team for supporting Miss Owens to create a brilliant morning for all involved.<br><br>On Tuesday evening our Year 9 students and parents attended the school to hear about and discuss their IGCSE options for next year. This is an important milestone for some of our older students as they start to think about future subjects they might wish to study. The evening was well attended and there were some great conversations had about the Year 10 curriculum for next year. We wish all those students the very best of luck with their discussions and decisions they have to make in the coming weeks.<br><br>I am sure you are aware that there has been a lot of media coverage recently about measles in Yangon. We have sought advice from a variety of experienced sources and have attached a summary information and guidance letter for you. We hope this is helpful.<br><br>Finally, I would like to give you advance notice that on Saturday March 23rd, we will be hosting a family fun day for all both existing and potential new families. The event will run from 10.00 to 1.00. Full details of the event will be released in due course.<br><br>I wish you all a very relaxing weekend.<br><br>Kind Regards&nbsp;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Paul Holyome&nbsp;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Principal&nbsp;<br><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 15.6933px;"><span lang="EN-GB">&nbsp;</span></p></div></div></font></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="2" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="">The British School Yangon</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
