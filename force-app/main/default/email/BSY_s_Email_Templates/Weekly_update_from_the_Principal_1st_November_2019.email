They will then give your child a “uniform pass” &nbsp;which they can show to teachers if they are questioned about their outfit. &nbsp;<br><br>We have seen a lot of trainers being worn recently. &nbsp; The uniform code does specify smart black leather or leather look shoes, so I would ask for your help in ensuring that students wear the correct footwear<br><br>For your information, when I met the supplier last Friday, I asked for the following adjustments to future items:<br><br>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;narrow the Primary polo shirt and add a little length to improve the shape and fit<br>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;provide waist adjustors in the boys’ shorts<br>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;add more length to the body section of the boys’ swimming shorts to come up higher on the waist<br>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;improve the quality of finish on the inside of boys’ shorts<br>· &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Provide a more tailored cut to the blazers so that they fit more neatly<div><br>I imagine there may be other suggestions that we can share with the supplier to help refine the overall look so there will be a comments box at Reception for the next week for everyone. (students, parents, staff) to contribute their ideas and feedback. <br><br><b>New Parent buddies</b><br><br>One of the areas of school life that we would like to improve is the support given to new parents and students. &nbsp;So, we are writing new “insider guides” to Yangon life and would also like to offer a buddy system. &nbsp;This would involve being in email contact, meeting up on arrival and generally providing local knowledge to help the settling in process. &nbsp; &nbsp; If you would like to be a friend to a new parent, please let Susan know, &nbsp;susan.thae@britishschoolyangon.org &nbsp;<br><br>I look forward to catching up with many of you tomorrow,<br><br>Warm regards,<br><br>Tor<div><br></div><div>Principal&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>British School Yangon&nbsp;</div></div></div></font></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
