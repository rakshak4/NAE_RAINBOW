I appreciate that this will have come as a surprise to many in the community. Just recently I was offered the opportunity to take up the role of Executive Principal at Compass International School in Doha, Qatar. The school is also part of the Nord Anglia Education family of schools and from August will be part of the South East Asia and Middle East combined region. The school currently has three campuses across the city with an additional new purpose-built campus opening in August. After very careful consideration, I decided to accept this offer and the new challenge to take on this promoted post. I will be sad to leave Yangon but am very proud of the achievements we have made as a community during my time here. I am confident that the school is in a good position to continue being successful and the best international school in Yangon. I would like to thank everyone for the enormous support you have afforded me over my time here. I shall be continuing to work hard for the school until my departure in the summer to ensure everything is in place for the new academic year.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I have already started work with the new Principal to ensure a smooth transition for the school. She will be coming to Yangon in the second week of June to meet with staff, students and parents. I will send you further information on her visit in due course.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I have been in Ho Chi Minh City since yesterday afternoon in the Regional Office. The purpose of my trip was to present, finalise and get approval for the school budget for the next academic year. As part of this meeting the fees for next year were discussed and finalised.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">As you may be aware the current inflation rate prediction for Myanmar is around 6%. From August 2019 school fees will rise by 4.5% for all year groups which is below the predicted inflation rate. A new schedule of fees will be published in due course.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">The EAL fees for those families using this service will increase by 10%. All other fees such as lunch and bus fees we have kept the same and will remain unchanged.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">We have kept the fee increase to the minimum that will allow us to maintain the same high quality of educational provision in a growing school. We remain convinced that we represent good value for money. We thank you for your continued support and commitment to our wonderful school.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">You will know from previous communications that the work on the values for the school continues at a pace. Please see information from Mr Carr-Jones who is now leading on this work:</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><i style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">First of all, on behalf of the school, may I thank you for your help in establishing the school's values. For my part, it was very illuminating to see in more detail what the community values, as well as to have the opportunity to engage in thoughtful conversation and debate with both students and parents alike. With the information we have, we appear to have a clearer picture of the direction in which the school body would like to go. But the process is certainly not over yet.&nbsp;<br><br>With that in mind, based on the feedback we have had from you, we would like to take the opportunity to open up the next phase of the process to you again with a joint meeting. Here, we will seek to thrash out what will ultimately become the school's values, based on the feedback we have had, and to draft potential mission statements.&nbsp;<br><br>This will be on Thursday 30th May at 17:00 to allow those parents with work commitments to attend. It will be a joint meeting of the Values' Committee, members of the Student Council, and those parents who would like to be involved. If you are interested, please RSVP to either myself &nbsp;anselm.carr-jones@britishschoolyangon.org or Mr Holyome by Monday 27th May.&nbsp;<br></i><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">On Tuesday our very first students sat an IGCSE maths examination. They have one more paper to sit. This was a key milestone for the school and an important benchmark in the school development.
