As many of you will know, we will be introducing a new uniform due the change in the management of the school from British Schools Foundation to Nord Anglia Education. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</font><div style=""><font size="2" style="" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>We had &nbsp;expected to have everything ready for distribution &nbsp;before the start of term. I am sorry to have to announce that the delivery has been delayed due to issues with sourcing the right fabric in the necessary quantities. &nbsp; We believe that the uniform will be ready for sale at the very latest by October half term; if we are ready earlier, we will of course let you know.<br><br>So, for the start of term we will need to have a temporary solution in place that allows us to maintain the already strong sense of pride in our &nbsp;students’ appearance and keep our school looking smart. &nbsp;<br><br>New Students&nbsp;<br><br>For all our new students, we will be opening the uniform store to provide you with a basic, “legacy” &nbsp;uniform until we receive the new stock. There will of course be no charge for this “old” style uniform. &nbsp; The school shop will be open on the following days;&nbsp;<br><br>Monday 29th - 9.00am - 12.00pm<br>Tuesday 30th - 9.00am - 12.00pm&nbsp;<br>Wednesday 31st - 9.00am - 12.00pm<br>Thursday 1st August - 9.00am - 12.00pm<br>Friday 2nd August - 9.00am - 12.00pm<br><br>If possible please do &nbsp;take some time to come in and select your uniform. &nbsp;If you are not in Yangon and able to make the dates or require a different time please email Thiri (thiri.bo@britishschoolyangon.org) and we will arrange assistance on a case by case basis. &nbsp;<br><br><br>Returning Students&nbsp;<br><br>Our existing students should, where possible, continue to wear the old uniform. &nbsp;If the uniform no longer fits or has been given away, I would ask you to go to the uniform shop on the following days. &nbsp;<br><br>Monday 5th August 9.00am - 12.00pm<br>Tuesday 6th August 9.00am - 12.00pm<br>Wednesday 7th August &nbsp;9.00am - 12.00pm<br>Thursday 8th August 9.00am - 12.00pm<br>Friday 9th August - 9.00am - 12.00pm<br><br>Once we understand your situation we will do our very best to help you to find a suitable solution. &nbsp;If you are not in Yangon and able to make the dates or require a different time please email Thiri (thiri.bo@britishschoolyangon.org) and we will arrange assistance on a case by case basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I hope that you will be as pleased as I am with the new uniform when it arrives, and that you will support me and the team at BSY in ensuring that we maintain a sense of pride &nbsp;in our appearance and high standards of dress in the interim period. As soon as we possibly can, we will let you know when the new uniform will be available for purchase, so that we can make the transition to our great new look.<br><br>I would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused and to also thank you for your understanding and continued support. &nbsp;If you have any questions please email me at mark.johnson@britishschoolyangon.org<br><br>Kind Regards,<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;<br><br>Mark Johnson&nbsp;<br><br>Business Director<br><br><br>The British School Yangon<br>www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></div></div></div></div></div>]]></td>
