It seemed a little strange coming back to school on a Thursday during the week.<br><br>Please be reminded that Term 3 After School Clubs (ASCs) are starting on Monday 6th of May and will continue until Friday 6th of June. ASC confirmation letters with their allocated ASCs were sent home with students today. Please contact Clara Tilemann (clara.tilemann@britishschoolyangon.org) if you have any questions. A big thank you to Ms Tilemann for arranging another exiting and full programme for the students.<br><br>BSY hosted the very first OLE Spanish event here on Thursday. As well as the Acting Ambassador for Spain here, we also hosted three schools who had a wonderful day of activities. Learning any language is an important part of preparation for life and we were delighted to offer our school as a venue for such a great event. I would like to say a special thank you to Ms Alicia Verde and her team for an amazing job in organising such a great event.<br><br>As I mentioned before we have had a group of staff now look at the values work for the school. Next week the group will be launching their ideas to the whole school community. Please see an update from Mr Carr-Jones representing the values committee below:<br><br><i>Dear Parents and families<br><br>Over the past several weeks, the staff have been discussing and compiling those values that you, the teachers, and the pupils have suggested should reflect the character of our school. Whilst our purpose has been to find commonalities and narrow down those suggestions we have received, we have made a point of ensuring that the diversity of opinions has been reflected in our long list of words we are putting back to the community for consideration. With that in mind, we want to thank all parents for the contributions that were made and would like to introduce you to the next stage of our deliberations, including the motivation for this process.<br><br>As I am sure you will agree, any organisation involved in the nurturing of young minds must have, at its forefront, a set of values that both reflect its stakeholders, but also develop our young people into the citizens we would hope for them to be: both for themselves; and for their communities. The values that we will decide upon will be embedded in the daily life of the school and, as such, it is imperative that we are all invested in them. The school is, no doubt, a broad church of different moral codes, which is why we would like to avoid a dictatorial approach, whilst ensuring that whatever the values are that we decide upon, reflect the diverse social and international makeup of the community.<br><br>Therefore, we would like to extend an open invitation for the next phase of input into the school’s values.<br><br>The format of this stage will reflect the open nature of our approach, and we hope will ensure that the widest possible range of opinions is secured. Next week, (w/c 6th May), the values committee will be leading informal discussions on the long list of values, as well as the categorisation we are using for them at this stage. Please bear in mind that these are by no means fixed, or definitive, but represent a working document. This will take place in the Grand Hall by the Yangon Bakehouse from 15:00 – 15:30 every day that week. On Wednesday 8th May, the session will be led by our Myanmar staff and will be conducted in Burmese for those parents who feel more comfortable discussing the proposals in their native language. At the same time, similar conversations will be happening with students and staff at lunchtime, and this will provide an opportunity for them to make their feelings known on our proposals at this stage.<br><br>Following on from this process, the Values Committee will use these words to draft a proposed mission statement from the school. More details of this will follow later once we have discussed your feedback over the following weeks.<br><br>We look forward to your contributions, and we hope that you will find this an engaging opportunity to imprint upon the school a set of values that will define us in the years to come.<br><br>We hope that many of you will take the opportunity over next week to feedback your views.<br></i><br>I wish you all a very relaxing weekend.<div><br></div><div>Kind Regards&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Paul Holyome&nbsp;</div><div>Principal&nbsp;</div></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div></font></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="2" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="">The British School Yangon</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
