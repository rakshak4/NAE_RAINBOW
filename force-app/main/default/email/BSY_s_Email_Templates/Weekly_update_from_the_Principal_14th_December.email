I am a little lighter and have a few more grey hairs, but I am very proud of what we have all achieved this first term. A huge thank you from me and on behalf of the school for your unwavering support, patience and good humour as we started out on this new journey.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">There is much to celebrate over the first term and too much to try and do justice to in a short letter such as this. We worked hard to ensure the new campus and the classrooms were ready. We have opened the swimming pool, the canteen and parent caf√©. Next term we will see the opening of the football pitch and EYFS outside play area. So, there is plenty more work to be done.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">The staff have been absolutely fabulous and I know you will join me in thanking all the staff who have worked tirelessly for the benefit of your children over the first term. I am very fortunate to have such a great team to work with in the school.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">The students have been an absolute delight. Our aim has been to ensure a smooth transition into the new building with the ultimate goal of having very happy children who want to come to school. I believe we have gone a long way to achieving this. The students have worked incredibly hard, played hard and have done the school very proud competing in competitions locally and across the region. I would like to thank them too for their support this term in making our school so great.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">We finished the term with a flurry of activities including the EYFS Christmas sing along and the Winter Gala event. Today in the final assembly the staff performed a festive pantomime for the students. A great way to finish the term. A huge thank you to everyone involved in supporting the success of these great events.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">It is inevitable that at the end of each term we have some families leaving the school for various reasons. I would like to take this opportunity on behalf of the school to thank those families for their contribution to BSY and we wish them well in their new adventures wherever that may be.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Finally, I wish you and your families a very happy and safe holiday and look forward to seeing you all back here on the 7th January. I myself shall be travelling back to the UK to see family before having a ski break in France with some friends. I shall return to Yangon on the 1st January to ensure we are ready for term 2.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">A very happy holiday to you all.</span></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;">Paul Holyome&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;">Principal&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div></font></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="2" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="">The British School Yangon</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
