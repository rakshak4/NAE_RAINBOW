As well as leading a very successful languages department in the UK, Dr. Rafael has been an Assistant Head in the past and will be a valuable asset to the school when she steps up to Assistant Head. Although, Dr. Rafael will continue to teach Spanish, we have appointed a new Director of MFL to lead that curriculum area and build on the good work Dr. Rafael has completed this year.<br><br>The post of Head of Key Stage 3 will be filled by Mr. Hill. Mr. Hill has experience of leading teams whilst a teacher but also in his previous life as a London Firefighter. His appointment will bring further stability to Secondary having also been a part of the teaching team this year at BSY.<br><br>Finally, in the new academic year, the Secondary Leadership Team will be &nbsp;further enhanced by the addition of Mr. Mycroft who is joining the school as a teacher of PE and Head of Key Stage 5. Mr. Mycroft currently works in the UK at a college with a very large sixth from of nearly 700 students. He joins the school with valuable experience of working in a significant post-16 setting and will be tasked with developing the best A Level sixth form offer in Myanmar.<br><br>Over the next couple of weeks you will be receiving information on class splits and classes for next year. You will also receive your childâ€™s report in the last week of term.<br><br>Many thanks for your support over the course of this academic year.
