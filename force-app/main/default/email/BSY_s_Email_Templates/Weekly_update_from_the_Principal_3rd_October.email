We can all be very proud of what we have achieved in a very short space of time. There is still lots to do and further improvements to make, but on the whole I am delighted with the progress the school has made so far this year. I know you will join me in thanking all the staff for their hard work and dedication in ensuring the best for your children.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I had the immense pleasure of attending my first ever primary house music competition today. It was an amazing event with all the children excelling for their houses. Thank you to all the parents who came along to support. Every house performed exceptionally well and what a fantastic way to finish the half term.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">As you know we have been meeting with senior hospital staff on a regular basis to build firm relationships as the school grows. They have alerted us to a growing number of school cars using their car park that is causing them some issues with their patients and their staff. They have asked us to urge parents not to use the hospital car park. Thank you for your consideration on this matter.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I would also like to update you on some campus developments. Straight after the half term break, the caf√© in the grand hall will have a soft opening for staff and parents to purchase coffee. I know there has been much anticipation around this and we are delighted that this will now be opening.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">The student canteen is due to be finished in the middle of next week. We then have to do a full handover and our catering supplier then needs fourteen days to set up the kitchens properly and carry out important health and safety cleaning and checks before opening. We anticipate that the canteen will be fully functional by the end of October as planned.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">The swimming pool is due to open for students on the 22nd of October, a full update will be given to you during the first week back after half term. &nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Can I please remind you that you must have a car sticker and you must be wearing an id badge whenever you visit the school. Please also advise nannies, drivers and family members of this minimum requirement. If you do not have either of these, please arrange for this as a matter of priority. Thank you again for your cooperation on this important matter.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">It just leaves me to wish you all a very safe and happy half term holiday. School will reopen on Monday 15th October with lessons starting at 8.00am. Have a wonderful break.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Paul Holyome</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><b style="">Principal</b></span></div><div style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; margin: 0px;"><br><br></div></font></span></div></div>]]></td>
