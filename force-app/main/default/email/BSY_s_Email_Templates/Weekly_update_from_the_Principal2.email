It has been incredible. We have achieved so much and it has gone so quickly!</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><font color="#222222">It has been an honour and a privilege&nbsp;to be able to lead BSY this year. There were challenges along the way, but at all times it has been reassuring to know that the support for BSY, for the staff and for me has been ever present. Collectively we have opened a new campus, brought together staff and children from three separate&nbsp;campuses and maintained the high level of teaching and learning that has been the trademark of the school for many years.</font><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><font color="#222222">We have had a wonderful final few weeks, culminating in the final reward assemblies. It is truly remarkable&nbsp;what has been achieved by the children this year and we should all be immensely&nbsp;proud of their endeavours. Well done everyone.</font><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">For me it was a very special and fitting way to end my time here. Whilst short in nature, I have enjoyed my stay here and have made many friends and worked alongside fantastic colleagues. I have worked with many parents whose kindness and support has been unimaginable. The children have always made me feel so welcome and I shall miss greeting them in the morning and saying goodbye to them at the end of the day.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">The staff have been absolutely incredible this year and I have been amazed with their patience, understanding and ‘can do’ attitude. They have taken all aspects of the school to a whole new level for the benefit of the children. I know you will join me in thanking them all for their exceptional dedication to the children.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Finally, I wish BSY the very best of luck for the future. I know the school will continue to go from strength to strength. I shall be keeping in touch with the school and the school will always have a special place in my heart. A big thank you to you all for your support, it has been greatly appreciated at all times.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I hope you all have a very safe and happy holiday.</span></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br></span></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Paul Holyome&nbsp;</span></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Principal&nbsp;</span></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br></span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 0px;"><br></div></font></span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="2" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="">The British School Yangon</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
