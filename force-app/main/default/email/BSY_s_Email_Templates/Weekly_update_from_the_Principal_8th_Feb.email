An exceptional show with some amazing performances to please the audience. Yet again the students have demonstrated what exceptional talents they have. It was an enormous pleasure to see this on display. Well done to everyone who took part, you have made a lot of people extremely proud.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Thank you those who attended the swimming gala on Tuesday. There was a fantastic atmosphere and the pool was buzzing with excitement. A huge well done to all our competitors. I was an extremely proud Principal watching our children perform. There were many, many wins for BSY and many personal best times broken. Well done to all our competitors, your many hours of hard training and practice really paid off.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I would also like to say a massive thank you and well done to all the students that have competed in a very action-packed term - cross country, swimming, athletics, volleyball and football events. They have all taken place this term and we have witnessed some amazing success from our students. &nbsp;No doubt now the facilities are all open and being used to capacity, even more opportunities, success and enjoyment will also develop! A big thank you to Mr Dean and the PE staff for such a great programme.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">On Wednesday we greatly enjoyed our third annual visit from British Theatre Company 'The HandleBards'. Their version of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night was hilarious and greatly enjoyed by students, teachers and parents.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">You will have received yesterday an email from the school asking you to complete a survey regarding the future direction of the school uniform. Many parents have met with me and discussed the current uniform and possible ideas. I promised that we would allow all members of the school community a say on this and this is your opportunity. We are also conducting a similar survey with the children in school and with all staff. We really do want everyone to have an input into this important decision. If you have not done so already, then please take some time to complete the survey. I have provided the link again below:</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdrKBCQth_MBkFzHZGr3DNVkK2gJv699Jej4hPybJArdkfcWQ/viewform?usp=sf_link" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">BSY School uniform - questionnaire</a><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">As I mentioned last week, from 18th February we have a new security company starting in school. I know you will welcome them to the school and be patient with them as they learn all about our wonderful community. They have a very serious task to undertake and understand the enormity of that responsibility. In their first week I have asked them to thoroughly check and challenge any car or person entering the site without a sticker or identity tag. Please ensure that your car has a sticker and that whenever you or a member of your family are on site you must be wearing your identity badge. Any visitors must sign in. Please expect to be challenged if this is not the case. I know like me you take the safety of your children seriously and this is an important part of our responsibility that we must all understand and support.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Finally, I wish you and your families a very safe and happy holiday break and look forward to seeing you all back here on Monday 18th.</span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br></span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Kind Regards&nbsp;</span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br></span></div><div style=""><font color="#222222">Paul Holyome&nbsp;</font></div><div style=""><font color="#222222">Principal&nbsp;</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 0px;"><br></div></font></span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="2" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="">The British School Yangon</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
