We will, of course, support with online learning during this time.<br><br><b>School Activities </b><br>Current guidelines recommend only necessary gatherings occur, so with regret, we will be cancelling Family Fun Day this Saturday.&nbsp; We have also taken the decision to cancel the Y10 Duke of Edinburgh and MUN trips planned for late February and the forthcoming Maths competition in &nbsp;Beijing. We will continue to review all activities and trips (including Primary Residentials) in school and will inform parents directly of any changes to planned activities. &nbsp;Mrs Del Federico is in touch with other Yangon school heads who will collectively decide on inter school activities. &nbsp;<br><br><b>Temperature Checks </b><br>Starting tomorrow, our nurses will be doing temperature checks with all staff and students as they arrive in the morning. &nbsp;Any staff or student with a temperature above 37.5 degrees will be asked to go home and seek medical advice. Bus monitors will be checking students as they get onto the bus, again, any children with temperatures above 37.5 degrees will not be allowed on the bus. &nbsp;Students will only be allowed back to school with a letter from their doctor.<br><br><b>During the school day</b><br>Any students who present&nbsp; flu symptoms during the school day will be sent to the school nurses for an assessment. If our nurses have any concerns about the health of a student, they will inform the parents to collect the student and advise them to seek medical advice. Students will only be allowed back to school with a letter from their doctor.<br><br><b>Staff visits to China </b><br>We have asked staff to let us know if they have visited China during CNY or spent time with anyone who has visited from China. All staff have been instructed to monitor their symptoms (fever, cough, runny nose) and have been asked to stay away from school until they have been checked.<br><br><b>School Cleaning </b><br>All sections of the school are cleaned daily with some areas (toilets, canteens and EYFS areas) cleaned more frequently. All rooms have hand sanitisers and children are encouraged to use it.&nbsp;<br><br><b>What other advice will staff give to children?</b><br>Staff will continue to give age-appropriate guidance on ensuring all students wash their hands effectively and not share food. Teachers will also ensure there is appropriate discussion of the issue and the general precautions we can all take.<br><br><b>Will the school need to take further action?</b><br>We will continue to monitor the situation and the updated advice from Nord Anglia, WHO and local medical experts. &nbsp;Any changes to our procedures will be communicated to parents directly.
