I have personally spent most of the lunch times going around and talking to students from all age groups and there did seem to be a genuine appreciation that the food has improved significantly this week. There is now more variety, balance and more vegetarian options. The freshly cut fruit station has proven to be a big hit. We have also received many ideas and thoughts from the students on what they would like to see that we will share with the chef. Mr Johnson will also be meeting with a small group of parents to get further ideas and suggestions for further improvements. Thank you to all those who emailed and thanked us for the work to improve the menus, it is greatly appreciated. We cannot be complacent on this issue as there is still much work to do in this area and we will continue our drive to make the provision as best as possible.<br><br>We continue to review the values that we wish to see in our school community. I have had two very good meetings with a focus group of parents. Teachers and students have also started to give their views on what they would like to see. I would also like to invite anyone who wishes to contribute to this important discussion to click on the link below and complete the simple form to support our ongoing work in this area.<br><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJRK--lGOf82Hx0RfuXFSTCsgLg1y20s2HGoB3rkK7q4dpOQ/viewform" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">Core Values Survey</a><br><br>I had the honour of joining other families and some of our students at the remembrance service on Sunday 11th November. All our students did a fantastic job in representing the school. Thank you to all those who came to support this special 100 year commemorative event. An important and sobering reminder to us all, the sacrifices that have been made by many from all nations around the world for what we have today.<br><br>As you may know, Nord Anglia Education has formed a strong collaboration with UNICEF. Each year all the schools across the world are set a challenge by UNICEF. Two global goals are selected for the schools to work on during the year. Today we launched the challenge to our students. Following the launch, we will be devising projects with the students that the whole community can get involved with. Next July we will send a few student representatives from our school to UN HQ in America to share our project work. This is a very exciting project and will give the school community a very clear focus on helping to address some very important issues faced by many across the world. The students have chosen Global Goal 16 to focus on. Please click on the link below to see the launch video:</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br>&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IrW4-KBRcBc" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">UNICEF Global Goals Challenge Video</a><br><br>Please be reminded that school will be closed next Thursday and Friday. Please also be reminded that there will be no After School Clubs running on Wednesday 21st November. The school will re-open on Monday 26th. I hope you will all take good advantage of this extended weekend opportunity.<br><br>I wish you all a very relaxing weekend.</div></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br>Paul Holyome&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;">Principal&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div></font></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="2" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="">The British School Yangon</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
