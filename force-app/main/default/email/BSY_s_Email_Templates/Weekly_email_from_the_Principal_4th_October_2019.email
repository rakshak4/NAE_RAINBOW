<p class="MsoNormal">Feel the fear and do it anyway<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Does&nbsp; the promise of
extrinsic reward&nbsp; denigrate the value of
a compassionate act?&nbsp;&nbsp; As I discussed
this with one of our brilliant students this week, I was impressed by his
powers of perception, and also the self-aware and &nbsp;thoughtful manner in which he had engaged with
our conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We were in a
student, staff panel, exploring&nbsp; how we
as a community are moving forward to understand, promote &nbsp;and underpin our school values.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">After many months of collaboration and consultation, we have
arrived at four core school values:&nbsp;
Kindness, Courage, Integrity and Adventure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Words, powerful as they may be, depend on
us to communicate them, to respond, to adapt and to adopt them into our
vocabulary.&nbsp; Hence we met this week &nbsp;as a representative group to talk through how
these words can be woven into the daily fabric of BSY life.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ideas from staff and students were
diverse and inspiring; we all agreed that&nbsp;
it was no good to “preach”, rather we need to live, to model, <i>to be</i>
those words.&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">As many of you will be aware, I spent the last weekend in
Switzerland on the annual Nord Anglia Education Senior Leadership
Conference.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am grateful to the
Executive Team who lead the school with&nbsp;
great care and dedication&nbsp; in my
absence.&nbsp;&nbsp; For three days,&nbsp; principals,&nbsp;
regional directors and the Ex. Co.&nbsp;
gathered in the heart of the Swiss Alps to discuss, share and co-create
a defining vision for the education we believe all our children should have
access to. &nbsp;&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">There was a chance too to enjoy the mountains.&nbsp; &nbsp;On one
of these excursions, &nbsp;I was confronted by
one of my own limitations: a tendency to vertigo. With the support,
encouragement and kindness of new colleagues, I somehow clambered, crawled, and
gasped my way gingerly&nbsp; across the narrow
ridge &nbsp;path, flanked by sheer vertical
drops and with a foehn wind blowing hard around us.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a potent reminder of how easily we
can succumb to fear, how quickly one can reject adventure and most importantly,
&nbsp;how kindness is integral to so many of
our personal and professional successes.&nbsp;
<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;As I reflected on the
experience,&nbsp; it made me think how rarely &nbsp;we&nbsp; adults
we find ourselves in these kind of situations, yet for our children, being
pushed, feeling scared, worrying about failing in front of peers, are all too
regular emotions as they move through their school lives.&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">So, as the school and I work together to enshrine these
values into our BSY&nbsp; life, I hope that
you as parents will join us&nbsp; in taking
chances to model and live them too.&nbsp;&nbsp; We
will be promoting and celebrating these ideals and as part of that, I would
like to invite you to contribute to our&nbsp;
collective endeavor.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Would you like to come and talk to students about a time you
had to act with integrity or&nbsp; great
courage?&nbsp; Perhaps you might wish to share
a piece of writing or art that resonates with one of our&nbsp; values?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Could you offer an older student a holiday work&nbsp; experience day&nbsp; to help see how these values transpose into
the world of work and life beyond school.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If&nbsp; you would like to get involved
in any of these , or indeed have other ideas,&nbsp;
please drop me a line at <a href="mailto:principal@britishschoolyangon.org">principal@britishschoolyangon.org</a>&nbsp; or catch me in person at school. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">In other news, Miss Tilemann would like to remind parents
that &nbsp;ASCs will continue as normal on
Monday and Tuesday next week. There will&nbsp;not&nbsp;be any ASCs on
Wednesday&nbsp; as term finishes that
day.&nbsp;&nbsp; They will resume again on Monday
October 21st.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Coming up next half- term, &nbsp;I am thrilled to announce that we are able to
act in response to&nbsp; your requests, &nbsp;and will launch “coffee and conversation” our
pilot&nbsp; English language course for
parents.&nbsp;&nbsp; More details to follow later this
month.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I would finally like to extend a personal thank you to all
of you and the students and teachers&nbsp; who
have welcomed me and my family,&nbsp; and have
in just these few weeks together,&nbsp; made
Yangon feel like home.<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">If I do not see you before term finishes, I hope that
you&nbsp; have a wonderful holiday with your
children. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Best wishes, <o:p></o:p></p>
