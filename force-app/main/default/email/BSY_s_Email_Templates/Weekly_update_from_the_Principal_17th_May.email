It has been great to have her in school to aid the transition into her new role. She has had an incredibly busy week, working with teachers and students to better understand the school. I know many of you have had the opportunity to chat with her during the week. Ms O’Callaghan has enjoyed her visit and is very much looking forward to formally joining BSY in August.<br></div><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Like many I had the immense pleasure of attending the Primary music concert last night. A fantastic event with an array of amazing musical talents on display. The children were fantastic, it was a great way to celebrate the hard work in music that has taken place this year. I know you will join me in thanking the music department, the teachers and the teaching assistants for putting together a wonderful spectacle for us.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Work on the values of the school continue and you will have received a further voluntary survey this morning to complete if you wish. The staff group will be meeting early next week to draw together everyone’s thoughts and ideas. They will then be calling a further meeting to include parents and students to start to finalise this piece of work. Final details to follow in due course.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">On Tuesday the school hosted a touch rugby tournament including a community team called Little Dragons. It was a wonderful event and a great deal of fun was had by all. We also had a collection of trainers that are now being donated to Little Dragons. I know they are very appreciated and a big thank you to everyone who donated.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">This week we also had two NAE visitors who have spent the last few days conducting further training and giving advice on quality assurance and safeguarding across the school. The time they spent with our staff was invaluable and will help us further strengthen these two important areas of the school.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I wish you all a very relaxing weekend.</span><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Kind Regards&nbsp;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br></div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Paul Holyome&nbsp;</div><div style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Principal&nbsp;</div><div><br></div></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div></font></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="2" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="">The British School Yangon</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
