However, the school continues to be as busy as ever. The school is certainly finishing with a bang with many events and activities packed into this time. I appreciate at such a busy time and with so much going on, it may be difficult for families to keep up with what is happening. I have therefore put together a summary sheet of all the main events taking place over the last few weeks as a quick reference guide. Please find attached a summary of all the events in the last two weeks. I hope you find this useful.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Last night we hosted another school values meeting. This was attended by staff, students and some parents. We had a very good discussion and are starting to finalise what the final values of the school might look like. The group have started to narrow the possible values down to four or five key words and will of course share this with you once done. I was particularly impressed with the students and how articulate they were during the discussions. The group will be meeting again next week, so I hope to send to you the summary from this discussion in my letter next Friday.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">A reminder please that next week is the last week of ASC’s. All ASC’s and swimming clubs will finish on Friday 7th June. I know you will wish to join me in thanking all the staff, parents and outside providers who have contributed to such an amazing set of activities for the children over the year. On behalf of the whole community I would also like to extend a huge thank you to Ms Clara Tilemann who has coordinated the programme this year. Coordinating such a programme is no easy task and she has done a magnificent job. Thank you.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">A note on the library. The last day that primary and secondary students will be able to borrow books from the library will be June 7th and all library books must be returned by Friday 14th June. Please can you help the children make a conscious effort to look under beds and through cupboards to ensure that all outstanding books are returned ready for next year.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Last night our Year 2 children and staff had a sleepover in school. There were many tired eyes around the school this morning! You will not be surprised to hear that the sleepover was a huge success. The children enjoyed themselves and behaved exceptionally well. I would like to thank the Year 2 staff for preparing and supporting such a great experience for the children.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I wish you all a very relaxing weekend.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br></span></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Regards</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;">Paul Holyome&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div></font></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="2" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="">The British School Yangon</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
