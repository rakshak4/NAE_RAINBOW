Both Tuesday and Thursday evenings saw many of our families in attendance and the feedback was exemplary from both parents and staff. Thank you for your time and efforts in supporting your child’s learning and the BSY ethos.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Alongside our PTCs, teaching and learning is moving at a pace, no winding down for half term here! The quality of learning, and the work being produced by the children is exceptional across the school. We have seen underwater worlds; teams building bridges, towers and slopes; shape sorting that generated many questions and discussions; the most beautiful ‘Dotty’ art; Children talking about consent and what that means to them as individuals. A highlight for me has been the Anderson shelters in year 6. An amazing project that tested the strength, safety and durability of the constructions the children produced.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">School wide, we celebrated World Languages Day this week with some exciting and challenging tasks. Yesterday morning all teachers were given a language in which to greet the children, the children then had to work out which languages were being spoken. The children were quite competitive as they travelled around trying to decipher the languages. Early Years put on a wonderful performance in the Grand hall, with renditions of ‘Head, Shoulders, Knees and Toes’ in a variety of languages! There was a competition to design the best world languages poster, and there were a number of unique designs.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">House Music rehearsals are really coming together, &nbsp;costumes are being prepared and the singing is a joy to witness!

As a school we employ a company called Javelin (The British Pest Control Company) to survey and recommend treatment for all pest control but especially treatment for mosquitos. Currently we run treatments in the evenings and at the weekends both internally and externally. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">There are additional measures you can take at home, you can give your children patches and also apply suitable insect repellent. &nbsp;If you would like further insect repellent applied at school please send this in your child's bag and contact the teacher. &nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">The Parent Social Group (PSG) met with myself and Mrs Michelle Dean this week to discuss preparations for our Intercultural Day Celebration in November.
