Students, staff and parents have all continued to work hard to make the term extremely successful. On behalf of the school I would like to extend my sincere thanks to you all for your continued support as we continue to grow and improve the school even further. I know you will also join me in saying a massive thank you to all the staff in school who have worked tirelessly for the benefit of all your children. They have all earned a well-deserved break. I would also like to thank all the children who have again excelled this term in everything they have done. We should all be very proud of their achievements.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">On Thursday I had the immense pleasure of attending the Year 4 production. It was incredible. The confidence that the children showed was very impressive. It was fun, engaging and very well executed by all. A very large well done to all the children and a special thanks to the Year 4 academic team, set designers and parents for their huge efforts in producing, preparing and supporting the children to deliver such an amazing performance.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">As I write this piece 14 of our students from Year 5 to Year 10 are currently performing in the South East Asia Music Festival in Hanoi, Vietnam. They have spent the week in Hanoi with the other schools preparing for the concert today. I am looking forward to seeing the video and hearing all about this wonderful experience they will have had. A big thank you to Mr Anselm Carr-Jones for leading on this initiative and running the trip. Also, a big thank you to Ms Asta Hodgson for supporting also on this initiative.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">In the first week back, we will be hosting a celebration for book week and on Friday 26th we are encouraging the whole community to dress up as a book character for one day. This promises to be a great way to start the final term of the year.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Over the last few weeks we have been working on a pilot programme that we will launch soon for weekend activities. &nbsp;The pilot programme will offer some activities for parents and students at the weekends as a pilot programme for five weeks in term 3. We will send further details and a sign-up sheet in the first week back after the holiday.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Finally, I wish you all a very safe and happy holiday. I know you will have some great times with your families and friends whether you are travelling or staying in Myanmar during the celebration period. I know the staff are looking forward to hearing all about the adventures and experiences when the children return.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Please be reminded that the school will reopen on Tuesday 23rd April at 8.00am.
