The schools have many things in common and we also face similar challenges in the city. This was the start of fostering and building new relationships with senior staff across the schools for the benefit of all. As part of this meeting I was able to review and discuss school calendars for 2019/20. I now have lots of good information that will enable me to complete and publish the timetable by the end of next week.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Mark Johnson and I met with the main contractor and the kitchen suppliers this week. As I mentioned last week in my letter, unfortunately the project has slipped behind the agreed schedule. This is disappointing and unfortunate for everyone. The canteen will now open on the 23rd November.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Birthdays are a cause for celebration and we understand that you wish for your children to celebrate with their classmates. If you wish to bring a birthday cake in for your child's birthday, please communicate the date and time in advance with your child's class teacher. A reminder, too, that a birthday cake or muffins for the class, is more than enough. Please do not bring in party bags, pizzas or drinks. Thank you for your support with this.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">On Monday I met with a small group of parents in a focus group to start discussing the mission and values of the school. This was the very start of the process and there will be more meetings ahead to continue discussions on this important area. Alongside this, staff in school are also starting to consider the mission and values of the school that they would like to see across the school. This piece of work will take the full year to complete properly and I will be seeking views from more parents on this issue over the coming weeks and months.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">A massive well done to everyone who attended the swimming gala event on Thursday evening. Unfortunately, I was unable to attend myself, but I was pleased to hear that there were a significant number of children testing their individual times in a variety of swimming disciplines. My understanding is that the event was well attended and very well organised. I know you will join me in thanking Mr Dean, his team and all the volunteer staff who helped make the event such a success for all.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">A large group of students continue to work hard on our Secondary Production, also featuring Year 6 students, of Little Shop of Horrors. Due to some technical difficulties in the development of our Theatre, we have changed the performance dates from December to January. We'd like you to join us for the performances on Tuesday 29th and Wednesday 30th January and we'll share further details with you on this nearer the time. Mr Coates has directly contacted all families involved in the production regarding this change and we thank them for their understanding.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">The team are also putting together the plans for the school's first ever 'Winter Gala' on Thursday 13th December. This will be an informal festive event for the whole school community here at BSY. Based in the Grand Hall we will serve seasonal refreshments from 4pm with performances from 5pm. We hope you will be able to join us for this.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">In addition, IGCSE Art and Music students have spent part of the day today at the French Institute in Yangon. They have been experiencing Virtual Reality Art and Music and Digital Creative Workshops. We are sure the event will further inspire their studies and thank Ms Pile for leading on this project.&nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I wish you all a very relaxing weekend</span></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br>Paul Holyome&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;">Principal&nbsp;</div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div></font></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="2" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="">The British School Yangon</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
