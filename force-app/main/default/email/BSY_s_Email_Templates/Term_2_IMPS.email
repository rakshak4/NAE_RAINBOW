If your child already has lessons, then you still need to re-register for Term 2. The link to the application Form can be found towards the end of this email.<br><br>Children in Reception are offered the chance to learn piano or violin. Children in Years 1â€“ 3 will be able to choose from ukulele, violin, cello, drum, and piano lessons. &nbsp;Whilst we offer classical guitar to this age group, it is recommended that children begin on the ukulele, as size and complexity of the instrument can often be a difficult barrier to learning. Additionally, lessons in viola and guitar are available for children in Year 3, and from Year 4 children also have the option of learning the French horn or trumpet. These individual sessions will take place during the school day, and will require students to be withdrawn from curriculum lessons for 25 minutes (Primary children), or 30 minutes (Secondary children). &nbsp;The IMP timetable will rotate weekly to ensure that your child is not missing the same classes each week.<br><br>Should your child be accepted onto the programme, they will need to have their own instrument on which to practise at home, as personal practice is integral to progress and subsequently enjoyment. Students should bring their instrument to school on days when they have lessons (apart from piano or drum students), and these should be clearly labeled to avoid loss or accidental swapping of instruments (both the instrument itself and the case). The school has a limited stock of violins, violas, and guitars, which can potentially be loaned during the first few weeks for the duration of the lesson only, and provided the instruments are not required at that time for PIP lessons. We are happy to advise about where to purchase instruments. If you look at the Terms and Conditions, which are accessible from the Google Form, you will see details of a music shop which offers discount to parents of BSY children.<br><br>The fee for Term 2, which will be a course of 7 lessons starting on January 21st, is $105 (USD), and is paid in full, directly to the school Finance Office. You will receive an invoice for this once your child is enrolled.<br><br>If you would like your child to participate in the programme, please fill out&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/a/britishschoolyangon.org/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjI6Lx7YugmWIKCIP8zPspXbn0G6LcB76nndid9B2ez1eh2Q/closedform" style="color: blue;"><span lang="EN-GB" style="">this</span></a><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: black;">&nbsp;</span>Google Form by Tuesday 11th December. &nbsp;Please be reminded that the number of places is limited and therefore successful applications are subject to availability.
