It was an extremely proud moment for us all. The students were fantastic. As you know, many hundreds of hours were dedicated to preparing for and delivering such a spectacular performance. As well as the main performers, students were involved in all aspects of the performance including technical, music, production set and back stage. The performance will be remembered for a very long time. A massive well done to all the students involved in the performance. I would like to extend a very special thank you to all the staff who supported and directed the performance. Like the students, the staff dedicated many hours and I know you will join me in thanking them for this high level of commitment. A final huge thanks to Mr Coates who was exceptional in directing the whole performance. On behalf of the whole school community a very big thank you.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">On Thursday afternoon we hosted the U14 volleyball tournament here at BSY. There was a fantastic atmosphere and some great matches to watch. Thank you to all those parents and students who came to support our teams. Yet again both our boys’ and girls’ teams performed exceptionally well with some extremely close fought matches. The girls finished runners up and the boys finished fourth overall. Well done to both teams. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">As you know we take the safety and security of your children very seriously. Consequently, have taken the decision to change our current security service company. We feel that there is more we can do to increase the level of safety and security and for this reason we are currently working with a new company. They will take over the security services of the school from 18th February. During this transition period, we will be working with our new provider on routines and procedures. We will of course keep you updated with any changes to our current practices as we progress.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">It is great to see the new outdoor pitch being widely used. We have seen plenty of activity including fixtures, PE lessons and break time use. Feedback so far from users has been extremely positive. I have seen many, many happy faces out there and I am so pleased that we now have this important facility up and running.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">The road outside of school is nearing completion.

Please support us by reminding drivers to drive carefully, slowly and with good attention when entering and driving through the school site.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">As you can imagine we have collected quite a lot of lost property over the year to date. We now have to do something with this otherwise it will become unmanageable. Next week we will be laying out all the lost property in the main hall for people to view and collect. If by the end of the week there are still items left then we will donate it to charity.
