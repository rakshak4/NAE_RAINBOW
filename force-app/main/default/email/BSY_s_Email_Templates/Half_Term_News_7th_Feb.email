Thank you too for giving us feedback via the parent survey. &nbsp;I expect the results in March after which point we will share them with you in a parent meeting.<br><br><b>Congratulations!</b><br><br>As I write, we have just closed the interschool Slam poetry competition which showcased a huge range of talent; these are voices that rang out loud and strong with messages that were poignant, powerful, funny and thoughtful. &nbsp; &nbsp;I am also delighted to inform you of the recent successes enjoyed by our Year 11 students who were successful in winning partial scholarships to a 2020 summer school at Cambridge University. They worked very hard on their essays, and their victory is well deserved. &nbsp; Maia and Kaiden both won a partial scholarship to a psychology summer school, Lorena won a partial scholarship to a medicine summer school and Julia won a partial scholarship to an English literature summer school. &nbsp; In other news, we wish Dr Rafael all the best as she starts her maternity leave: &nbsp;we all look forward to the new arrival!<br><br><b>Coming up</b><br><br>Finally, following the December trial edition, and as we continue to refine our communications, we will be sending out monthly BSY photo newsletters from late February &nbsp;designed to highlight our students’ achievements and all the opportunities they have enjoyed.<br><br>We are also excited to be planning a spectacular end of term finale; a summer gala ball… more news next month!<br><br>On behalf of all the team at BSY &nbsp;I wish you and your families an excellent half term break.<br><br>Best regards,<br><br>Tor<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Tor Del Federico<br>Principal<br><div><br>The British School Yangon<br></div></span></font></div></div><div style="text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
