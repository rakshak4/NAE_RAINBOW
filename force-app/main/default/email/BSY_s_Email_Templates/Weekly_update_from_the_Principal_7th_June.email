We have not stopped and just keep on going.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">On Monday evening we witnessed a quite extraordinary light art exhibition on the third and fourth floor. It felt like we were actually in a formal art exhibition space. It was great to see so much art work displayed from across all year groups in the school. This was a culmination of a whole year of work and preparation and it was spectacular. I know you will join me in congratulating all the students who produced art work or were part of the art exhibition on Monday, well done to you. And of course a very special huge thank you to Ms Yasmine Pile and Ms Theigi Aung our amazing art teachers who have supported the students throughout and put together such a stunning display, thank you.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">On Tuesday the Year 7 and 8 students hosted two performances of their drama play Ernieâ€™s Incredible Illucinations. Another example of the wonderful talent we have in the school. It is great to see the younger students in secondary performing such great drama skills early on in their secondary career. A big well done to the students and a huge thank you to Mr Coates and the team for arranging this amazing drama piece.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">On Monday and Tuesday we had two very important visitors in the school. The school has applied to become a member of the prestigious federation called FOBISIA. This Federation currently has over 50 of the very best British international schools in Asia. Please see the link below:</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">FOBISIA Website</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">If successful, this will afford some fantastic opportunities for our staff and students. The two visitors spoke with staff, parents, students and SLT. They spent time looking in classrooms and looking at how the school is being led and managed. We will have to wait a while to know if we have been successful in our application. However, the initial feedback I received from the visiting team was overwhelmingly positive. They loved the school and were very impressed in what we have achieved as a young school to date.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">On Wednesday and Thursday over 130 students performed their IMP recitals across the school. The school building came to life with music being played everywhere. To have so many students involved in music is very special indeed. The talent on display was quite breath-taking. The students had obviously worked and practiced incredibly hard to reach such a high level of performance skill. A very large thank you to our extremely dedicated IMPs teachers who have afforded such great opportunities for the students in the school.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">You will have seen that the school has been immersed in an Eco week. There have been many activities, presentations, projects, assemblies and messages delivered during the week to address this very important topic. I would like to thank the Eco Committee and the many staff and parents who have been involved in making the week such a huge success. However, it does not stop there and we must all continue to work hard on this topic going forward.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">The school values work continues at a pace and there was a further meeting here in school today. Mr Carr-Jones will be meeting with the new Principal when she visits next week to bring her up to speed on the work to date.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">After much consideration, research and feedback I can now finally reveal the school sport mascot moving forward. The school mascot will be the BSY Bear. We are currently mocking up some designs ready for a formal launch in August. Thank you to everyone for your feedback on what has not been an easy thing to decide.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Finally, a reminder that Ms Victoria Del Federico the new Principal will be visiting the school next week. She will be in school on Wednesday and Thursday. There will be an informal opportunity for you to meet with her in the school theatre at 3.15 on Wednesday June 12th. She will do a short introduction about herself and talk with parents who wish to know a little more about her.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I am now getting my self ready for what promises to be a wonderful Sports Awards evening here in school.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">I wish you all a very relaxing weekend.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Paul Holyome&nbsp;</span></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div></font></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="2" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="">The British School Yangon</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
