Students were challenged to complete one of the MIT challenges for this academic year - Extreme Exposure. Students worked in teams to design and build prototypes of imaging devices they would use to photograph an extreme environment. They did this in teams and Nay Chi, from Y6, and her team gained second place in the festival.<br><br>The festival was a great opportunity for our students to meet children and teachers from other schools in the Nord Anglia family. The festival itself offered the opportunity for students to work collaboratively and creativity to solve a novel and challenging problem. Our students did themselves and BSY proud in their conduct and levels of participation.&nbsp; A massive thank you to Ms Sugdon for organising and leading this trip. &nbsp;<br><br>On Tuesday morning after a briefing and some warm up games the EYFS parents took to the field to participate in a variety of games and activities with their children.&nbsp; As a parent of a child in Reception is was a fantastic insight into the various movements and skills that our youngest students are being taught.&nbsp; The children were delighted to see parents joining in and the parent relay at the end was a fun way to finish a great morning. (Award for parent who took this the most seriously goes to our very own Head of Secondary, Mr Gilberthorpe!) &nbsp;Huge thanks to Ms Dunne and Ms Tilemann for putting on such an insightful and entertaining morning. &nbsp; <br><br>Parental involvement for EYFS didn't finish on the sports pitch as they also ran a phonics workshop on Thursday.&nbsp; In this presentation parents were shown how children learn phonics in school and how parents can support their learning at home.&nbsp; Parent involvement did not stop there as parents then collected their children to try out some of the phonics activities together.&nbsp; They practiced blending and segmenting words at both Nursery and Reception levels.&nbsp; Again this is a great insight into what happens in the classroom and was thoroughly enjoyed by the children.&nbsp; A passion for reading is so often born at a young age and it was great to see how the EYFS department is creating enthusiastic and curious young readers. &nbsp; &nbsp; <br><br>On Thursday and Friday this week we were excited and honoured to have a visit from Stephanie Cunningham from the Juilliard School. Steph is a drama curriculum specialist and is collaborating with our own Creative Arts Director, Mr. Coates. Throughout the two days Stephanie has taught workshops and observed lessons in various classes and key stages. Talking about her workshop for Year 4B, Ms Finley enjoyed how engaged the students were;</div><div><br></div><div>"I think that every single member of 4B was engaged, they were watching, they were taking part, they were putting up their hand and they wanted to have a go!"<br><br>Feedback from the students echoed this with many speaking about how much enjoyed the magic rope, an activity that encouraged students to use their whole bodies to make those watching believe that the invisible rope was both real and magical.<br><br>For anyone wanting to know more about Juilliard and why we consider it such an important partnership please see this link -&nbsp;<a href="https://www.juilliard.edu/school" style="white-space: pre-wrap;" target="_blank">The Juilliard School </a><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;">     </span><div><span style="white-space: pre-wrap;"><br></span></div>This week we also held our first Let's Talk Conversation Class with teachers from The British Council.&nbsp; I am happy to report that the class was attended well and enjoyed by all.&nbsp; We are hoping that the news travels fast and these classes are enjoyed by even more parents in the future. &nbsp; <br><br>Finally I would just like to say a big thank you to the parent lunch committee.&nbsp; We have already met twice this academic year and their excellent feedback has led to some great ideas and positive changes.&nbsp; I have no doubt that these meetings have contributed to a better lunch experience for our students and teachers.&nbsp; There is always room for improvement, but it has been a very positive start to the year. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br><br>With Monday being a public holiday, I would like to wish you all a fantastic long weekend! &nbsp;<br><br>Kind Regards <br><br><br>Mark &nbsp;<div></div></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div dir="ltr" class="gmail_signature" data-smartmail="gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><div><b>Mark Johnson&nbsp;</b></div><div>Business Director&nbsp;</div><div></div></div></div></div><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div></font></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="2" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="">The British School Yangon</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
