These festivals have afforded our students the opportunity to travel to Sau Paulo, Nanjing, Moscow, and Kuala Lumpur to take part in large scale rehearsals and concerts in a number of musical disciplines, as well as the chance to engage in cultural activities and explore new cities and lifestyles. I am delighted to deliver the exciting news that in order to celebrate the opening of our brand new campus, we are hoping to host the festival in March 2019.</div><div><br></div><div>The finer details of exactly what activities will run, the ages of participants, and repertoire will not be confirmed until next academic year, but in these initial stages of organisation we would like to invite you to host students from other schools for the duration of the festival week. Our students have been hosted by families in the past, and below you can read about their experiences. There is also a statement from a family consisting of a mother and daughter in Moscow who hosted one of our Year 5 students last year.</div><div><br></div><div>It will not be obligatory for host students to take part in the music programme if this is not something that interests them, but they would be welcome to join excursions and other workshop activities throughout the week. There will also be special consideration given to children who are starting their IGCSEs, so that there will be minimal impact on their studies.</div><div><br></div><div>Visiting students will ideally be placed in pairs, but older students could also be individually hosted. Homestay students will be of a similar age to your own child(ren) where possible, and you will be able to ask for more specific requests as well if you have any particular issues or concerns. The provisional dates for the festival are 11th-15th March 2019. In order for us to ensure the best possible experience for everyone involved, we would like you to simply register interest in taking part in this homestay programme. If you complete the form registering your interest,&nbsp;<b>you are not at all obligated</b>.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div></font></span><div style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Arial, sans-serif">If you and your family are interested in hosting one or more visiting students next March as part of the BSY International Music Festival, then please complete&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScn2v7ay2SKtAx4DFPixwd1CelFQYrsDZfTWDhuAgCldNDS7Q/viewform" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en-GB&amp;q=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScn2v7ay2SKtAx4DFPixwd1CelFQYrsDZfTWDhuAgCldNDS7Q/viewform&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1527829955862000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEQpQveBy3d373wt9UACY3NjiY38A" style="">this</a>&nbsp;Google Form by Wednesday 6th June.</font></div><div style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div class="m_8612938834321129286gmail-adL" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><span class="m_8612938834321129286gmail-im" style=""><font face="Arial, sans-serif"><div style="">We hope to have an encouraging response in order to start organising what should be a momentous occasion for BSY.

We spent the weekend doing many fun things such as trampolining, chocolate making, visiting the Zoo and playing at home. During the week of the festival the girls were busy each day with music rehearsals and day trips organised by school. In the evening we went to the parks, cooked meals together and the girls had hours of fun during this week long playdate! We were in contact with our guest's family via Viber and shared many messages and photographs with them. She had the opportunity to call them each day but was often too engrossed in playing and enjoying herself that she didn’t feel homesick.</i></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span lang="EN-GB"><i>We were very sad to say goodbye to our visitor, and to watch her bus drive off at the end of the week. We would most certainly offer to be a host family again. It was a wonderful experience. Caitlin made a new life-long friend and had a magnificent week. To me our guest felt like a second daughter, she was a joy to host.</i></span></p><b><br></b></div><div style=""><b>Y9 BSY festival participant:</b></div><div style=""><div style=""><i>It would be amazing to be a host to a student next year. I have been to Nanjing, Moscow and KL...I really think that being with a family is so special because you make new friends and it is an experience that introduces you to what may happen in the future when you may become roommates with someone completely new.&nbsp;</i></div><div style=""><i>The experiences I have had with my home stays were fantastic. Staying with a family means you don’t have to do everything with your school, and gives you the chance to meet with people that you wouldn’t have met otherwise.&nbsp;Also staying with a family gives you the option to explore what you are interested in doing whilst you are in Myanmar or any other country.&nbsp;</i></div><br></div><div style=""><b>Y9 BSY festival participant:</b></div><div style=""><i style="">Being a part of the homestay programme has honestly provided me with some of the best experiences of my life! I have stayed with a total of three families, and each and every one of them were so unique and nice that I’ve always had trouble leaving at the end of the festival week. It’s really interesting and fun staying with families of different cultures and sizes, surprisingly I’ve stayed with families with one child, two children and three children. I made really good friends with children my age, older and younger, and I still keep in touch. Learning the routines and lifestyles of my hosts really brought out responsibility in myself, as I had to adapt to lifestyles affected by a different city, different climate, different cuisine etc. I had experiences I’ll never forget, made friends along the way and learned so much more about cultures, lifestyles and of course, music.</i></div></font></span></div><font face="Arial,Sans-Serif" size="3" style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt;"><br></font></div></span><div style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font face="arial">{!Contact.SchoolText__c}</font></div><div style="font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif;"><i style=""><font class="Apple-style-span" style=""><b style="">World Class Education</b></font></i></span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: left;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif">__________________________________________________________</font></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: arial; font-size: 12pt; text-align: center;"><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Arial, sans-serif" size="1">{!User.School_List_Email_Footer__c}</font></div></div>]]></td>
