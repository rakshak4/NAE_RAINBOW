It was great to see them arrive back safely at school looking a little bit tired but with many stories to tell. Opportunities like this are great for the children and help foster independence and an opportunity to engage in experiences they would not otherwise get in school. As you know these trips do not happen by accident. Much time is spent by the trip leader, the teachers, the teaching assistants and the school in preparing for these opportunities. The staff give up an enormous amount of their time including pre-risk assessment visits for the benefit of all. I know you will join me in thanking all the staff involved in organising and running such great experiences for the children. Without their hard work and commitment, it just would not happen. Thank you to all involved.<br><br>In our Theatre, rehearsals continue for our Year 2 Production of 'Dave', written and directed by Ryan Sherwin. Thanks for all the hard work going into this from the Year 2 and Creative Arts Teams, we are greatly looking forward to the performances next week.<br><br>We were pleased to host the annual Yangon Slam Poetry Competition this week. Attended by more than 60 students from 5 international schools, the event was a great success and a tremendous showcase of performance poetry prowess from across our city. Congratulations to our Trophy winners, Ava, Ada and Maeva and to Mrs Kearon-Wiles for leading the event.<br><br>After much discussion, survey work and double-checking other sport mascots for our closest schools, we have reached a decision on our school mascot. I am delighted to announce that the mascot for the school will be the ‘Bulldog’. We are currently finalising our designs and will then formally launch to all. We are in good company. I believe as well as being a significant British icon, there are many other sports teams and organisations around the world who have the same mascot.<br><br>Yesterday and today we had four shortlisted candidates in school being interviewed for the soon to be vacant post of Head of Primary. As well as interviews with me before this week, they also had interviews with the education team in Oxford. Over the last two days they have met with many panels including, staff, students and parents. The selection process concluded today with formal interviews. Once a decision has been made, I will of course inform you of the outcome. Thank you to all those who were involved in the rigorous process over the last two days.<br><br>Thank you to everyone who completed the uniform survey. We had an amazing response with a large percentage of families completing and giving us great feedback. We are now in the process of asking the students. Once this is complete, we will study all the results carefully and then make our final decision on the future direction. We will of course communicate this with you once decided. Thank you to everyone for your feedback on this.<br><br>I wish you all a very relaxing weekend and good luck to our swimmers tomorrow at the swim competition here at BSY.<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt; line-height: 13.91px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 15.6933px;"><span lang="EN-GB">Kind regards&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 15.6933px;"><span lang="EN-GB"><br></span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 15.6933px;"><span lang="EN-GB">Paul Holyome&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 15.6933px;"><span lang="EN-GB">Principal&nbsp;</span></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 15.6933px;"><span lang="EN-GB"><br></span></p></div></div></font></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="2" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="">The British School Yangon</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
