Unfortunately, it was not the dry sunny day we were hoping for! However, the children were extremely happy that they now have their own on-site pool to have lessons, galas and inter school competitions in. This is another great additional facility and I am looking forward to watching the whole swimming pool area come to life.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Next week on Thursday 1st November sees the inaugural event for the BSY Swimming Pool. &nbsp;The PE Department is hosting a BSY Time Trial meet for students in Year 3 to Year 10. This event will take place after ASCs at 4pm in the Swimming Pool. Primary students can sign up to time trials in all 4 strokes over 25m and 50m and 100m IM. &nbsp;Secondary students can sign up to time trials in all 4 strokes over 50m and 100m and 100m IM. There are no medals or winners. This is an event for all swimmers to race to their potential and get a time for distance and event. &nbsp;We aim to host these on a termly basis so that students can track and monitor their own progress over time. Following the event, there will be some food available in the Grand Hall.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">In order to sign up â€“ please click on the link&nbsp;</span><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSclAm8YWxLPqB9Qo3HchsQLrIFRngT-s96E5iNVPs8g7nkZ-w/viewform" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204);">here</a><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">&nbsp;and follow the instructions on the form.

Over 500 people were in attendance and it was great to see how effective the grand hall space can be used for such events. I know the committee, parents and students spent many weeks preparing for this and I would like to thank everyone who was involved. I have received some comments regarding the timing of the event and as part of my review of next years academic calendar I shall take these comments into consideration.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">On Monday I met with the parent volunteers for our first ever PTG group. This is new territory for the school but an important step forward in further engagement with parents. We have started to work through how the group might work to best support the school but, as with anything new, there will be lots of learning to be done as the group evolves. Please bear with us as we continue to develop this initiative during the year. As I have stated in many meetings and conversations, this group does not replace any other engagement strategies we have. It is another part of the whole that will contribute to the school having greater support from the parent body. If you wish to join this group and are able to commit to regular meetings at the school, then please let me know.</span><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1I3G2IR13daUjc0yzurNhyk31MvnRwwY6/view?usp=sharing">Parent Teacher Group</a></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Mark Johnson and I have a meeting on Monday with the contractors to discuss the new canteen building. We are still pushing for an opening in just over seven days time as planned. However, I fear there might be a slight delay in this opening as it appears they may not have made sufficient progress in the kitchen set up that we were anticipating. I will of course keep you updated on the progress in this area. Please be assured that we are working hard to ensure that the contractors meet the deadlines agreed with us.</span><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);">Please be reminded that on Monday morning at 8am in the school theatre I am going to launch an important piece of work on evaluating the mission and values of the school.
