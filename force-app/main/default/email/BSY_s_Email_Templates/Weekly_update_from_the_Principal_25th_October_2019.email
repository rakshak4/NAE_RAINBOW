This will consist of a talk to parents about how Phonics is taught in EYFS, followed by a short, hands-on Phonics session in which parents will be invited to try out learning alongside their children in their lesson! If you would like to join this workshop, please email our Head of EYFS, Mrs. Thomas (charlotte.thomas@britishschoolyangon.org) by next Friday, 1st November.<br><br>The Sports department are also hosting a “Back to class” Sports and physical literacy seminar with a practical workshop for parents on Tuesday 5th November – EYFS and Tuesday 12th November - KS1. &nbsp; Both events start at 8.30 am with refreshments. &nbsp; More information to follow from Miss Dunne next week<br><br>The Parent Social Group have been working hard on Intercultural Day, intended to celebrate the range of cultures, traditions and identities. &nbsp;Please do join us on Saturday 2nd November so that we have a great turnout and lots of fun.<br><br>I am grateful this week to the efforts of Miss Smailes and the Primary team who organized an amazing celebration of 5 ways to wellbeing this week. &nbsp; The photos will be shared with you in due course and you will see for yourselves what a wonderful week the children have had. &nbsp; From Workout Wednesday to Fun Friday, our school was even more full of life, laughter and positive energy than usual.<br><br>A key part of wellbeing is acting with empathy and compassion, having an understanding of others and the wider world. &nbsp;So I am delighted that our student council and Prefects have worked together to organize the &nbsp;first &nbsp;whole school fundraising event of the year. &nbsp;Their letter follows below:<br><br><br>Dear BSY community, <br><br>Next week we will be holding our first charity fundraising event of the academic year. Primary School Council have spent the first school term deciding how they would like to raise money for the schools chosen charity, Wildlife Conservation Society Myanmar. As a council, we collectively chose to hold BSY's first 'No-Uniform Day'. <br><br>This event will be happening on Thursday 31st October, and means that all staff and students will have the option to come in to school in casual dress. Incidentally, our No-Uniform Day also happens to fall on Halloween so students and staff can also choose to wear their spookiest Halloween costume! <br><br>To participate, we're asking for donations of up to 5,000ks which should be given to Class Teachers and Form Tutors on Thursday. We believe the chosen charity is an incredibly worthy cause and that the money raised will be used to protect the wildlife and environment of the beautiful country we live in. &nbsp; <br><br>We hope you have a lovely weekend.<br><br>Primary School Council<br><br>On behalf of all the team at BSY, I wish you and your children a peaceful and relaxing weekend, and a very happy Deepavali.<br><br>Best wishes,<br><br>Victoria Del Federico</div><div>Principal&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></div></div><div style="margin: 0px;"><br></div></font></span></div><div style="text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="2" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="">The British School Yangon</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
