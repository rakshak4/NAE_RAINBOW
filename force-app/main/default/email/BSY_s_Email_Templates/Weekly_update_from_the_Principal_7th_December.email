EYFS sing along, Winter Gala and much more in the classrooms during the closing week.&nbsp;<font style="">Whilst I have personally not be involved in the set up and preparations for the events. I would like to thank all the staff, students and parents in advance for the hard work, I know the planning and logistics has taken many weeks.<br></font><br><font color="#222222">I continue to receive much praise for the improvements in the canteen food. I was pleased to see the chef experimenting again this week with variety on the menu and it is nice to go into the canteen and have nice surprises and occasional treats. However, as I said before there is still more we can do and we will continue our consultation and drive to make it as best we can for all.</font><br><br><font color="#222222">We have now finalised the school calendar for the academic year 2019/20. You can access the calendar using the following link:</font></div><div style=""><span style="color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"><br><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 15.6933px;"><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://www.nordangliaeducation.com/our-schools/myanmar/yangon/british/news-and-insights/next-academic-year-calendar-2019-2020" target="_blank" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.nordangliaeducation.com/our-schools/myanmar/yangon/british/news-and-insights/next-academic-year-calendar-2019-2020&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1544257293886000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEhpTPrqALPXHUYtLuYWfqpudlRnA" style="color: rgb(5, 99, 193);"><span style="background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;">Academic Calendar 2019-2020</span></a></span><u><span lang="EN-GB" style="color: rgb(17, 85, 204); background-image: initial; background-position: initial; background-size: initial; background-repeat: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial;"></span></u></p>We have an increasing number of local Myanmar staff working for us who are on local contracts. We will therefore close the school on all the main public holidays. Where possible we have also arranged some of our mid-term holidays to coincide with the main holiday periods. We appreciate that the holidays sometimes change at short notice or additional ones added. We will be doing our very best to ensure we do not change our calendar. However, if this becomes necessary and after careful consideration, we would do our best to inform you well in advance of any changes required.<br><br>On Monday the work started on the roof at the back of the school for the astro turf pitch. We are monitoring the works very closely. They appear to be making steady progress on the structure. On Monday next week the builders will be starting work at the bottom end of the area next to the swimming pool. I have therefore made the decision to close the swimming pool for the final week of the term, whilst they start work next to that area. This does not affect swimming squads and programmes as they concluded today. But it will mean swimming lesson during pe lessons will be postponed until January. Thank you for your understanding on this and apologies for any inconvenience caused.<br><br>As I have mentioned on </span>many&nbsp;<font style="">occasions</font>, w<font color="#222222">e have to change our uniform in August 2019. We are currently exploring options of possible providers and manufacturers in the area that we might be able to use. From January to March we will be working hard to consult on and design some possible uniform designs for the students.</font><br><br><font color="#222222">This week you will have received a separate email from me asking for your support in completing the annual parent survey. I hope as many of you as possible will take the opportunity to anonymously give us feedback on how we are doing. This can only enhance the good work we have already started in increasing parental engagement across the school. We only need one submission per family please. Thank you in advance for taking the time to support this process.</font><br><br><font color="#222222">Please be reminded that the school will close at 11.30am on Friday. Please ensure your travel arrangements have been adjusted to accommodate this earlier finish time. School buses will leave just after this time to bring students home.</font><br><br><font color="#222222">I wish you all a very relaxing weekend.</font></div></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 0px;"><br>Warm Regards,<br></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 0px;"><br></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin: 0px;">Paul Holyome&nbsp;</div></font></span></div><div style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); text-align: left;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font size="2" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="">The British School Yangon</font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); margin-right: 0px; margin-left: 0px;"><font face="Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);" size="2">www.britishschoolyangon.org</font></p></div></div>]]></td>
