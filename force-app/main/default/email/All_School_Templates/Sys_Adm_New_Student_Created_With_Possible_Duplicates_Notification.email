Student numbers should be consistent from school to school i.e. the same physical student should only have one student number in both/all schools, just with a different "-X" number appended to it.<br><br>Please also check to ensure that the actual physical student does not have more than 1 student academic file and that the one that does exist is connected to the opportunity in the school where they are currently enrolled, or the next school if they're not currently enrolled, where the student number doesn't contain a "-".<br><br>If the student is changing campus or similar and has a "-0[number]" at the end of their student number then you will receive another email notification shortly before they start school at which point the active student number should be updated and the relevant student academic file moved. This typically cannot be done now as an existing, matching student is already enrolled in school.<br><br>This is an automated message.<br><br><br><br></td></tr></tbody></table></span>]]></td>
