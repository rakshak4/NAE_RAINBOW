Please ensure that the stage of all other student records for this child are not 'Enrolled' or ‘A/ Deposit’ and ‘Attending School’ = ‘Yes’. If one is found then you should make a note to update the records once the current student leaves according to the following. If the none are found you can proceed now. Note that no further reminders are sent for this process.<br><br>Please update the student number via the 'Student Number Override' field to exclude the "-" and trailing number. You will likely need to update another student record for the same physical student first, by adding the current 'Student Number' in the 'Student Override Field' and appending it with "-1", or another number if there are more than 2 records for the same student.<br><br>Please also ensure that the student has the latest student academic file correctly related to their record i.e. lookup from opportunity to contact (Student Academic File) and lookup from contact to student (Admissions File) are correct and show in total no more than 2 record IDs (one for the contact and one for the opportunity).<br><br>Finally, if the student number ended in anything other than "-0", the student starts school within the next 14 days and the school use Kompanion, please click the 'Send Student to Kompanion' button to ensure that the student and contact records are sent to Kompanion and any required users are created.<br><br>This is an automated message.<br><br><br><br></td></tr></tbody></table></span>]]></td>
