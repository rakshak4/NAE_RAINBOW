Parents organising rooms please feel free to contact by email your staff helpers for the set up on Friday.

Visiting the countries!


Children will be able to visit each room with their parents, partake in the activities set and collect stickers for their passports. Please note the format of UN Day has changed from previous years and parents will be asked to supervise their own children on the day. You are free to visit the countries in any order during the event. Staff will be on hand to help direct you to the various countries.


UN Day Lunch 12:00 – 13:00


Our UN Day Buffet lunch will take place in the cafeteria at approximately the same times as usual for Foundation Stage and Primary. All contributions to the lunch are gratefully received! Please be aware that it is school policy that food served should not contain nuts (owing to allergies).


Celebration Assembly at 13:00


There will be a celebration assembly at 13:00, featuring Indian, Azerbaijan, Chinese, Polish and Russian dancing and Uzbek folk music.


Other important information for parents


Owing to the need to prepare rooms in advance of the event, parents, volunteers and staff will begin decorating rooms from 15:30 on Friday 21st November.


On Friday 21st November, child-care will be provided only for parents who are assisting with setting up rooms for the event.  All other children from Upper Campus should be collected at 15:30 from the theatre.


Please remember that children &amp; staff should wear a national costume of their choice on UN day instead of their school uniform.


We look forward to a successful event!


Kind regards,


David Kirkham
